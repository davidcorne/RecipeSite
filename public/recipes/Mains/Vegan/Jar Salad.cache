# Jar Salad # 

This is a technique for making salad in a jar for easy meal prepping and it sounds really useful. It's originally from [this site](https://hurrythefoodup.com/how-to-pack-a-salad-in-a-jar/).

## Equipment

- Clean jars with lid (around 24oz/ 700ml)

## Dressings

Each of these portions is enough for 2 jars.

### Refreshing sweet and sour dressing
- Â½ lemon
- 1 tbsp honey
- 5 tbsps olive oil
- Pinch of cumin
- Pinch of salt
- Couple of chili flakes (or dried cayenne pepper will do the trick nicely)

### Honey Mustard Dressing
- 4 tbsp olive oil
- 3 tbsp vinegar
- 2 tbsp mustard
- 2 tsp maple syrup (or honey for non-vegans)
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Asian Style Peanut Butter Dressing
- 1 tbsp peanut butter
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp honey or maple syrup to make it vegan
- 1 tbsp vinegar or lemon
- 2-3 tbsp water
- A pinch or two of chopped or grated ginger (dried is fine)

## Ingredients

- Layer 1: your favourite dressing
- Layer 2: tomatoes, cucumbers, red onion, asparagus, celery, peppers, carrots
- Layer 3: mushrooms, zucchini, beans, lentils, peas, corn, broccoli
- Layer 4: boiled eggs and cheese (feta, gouda, cheddar etc.)
- Layer 5: rice, pasta, quinoa or couscous

## Method ##
