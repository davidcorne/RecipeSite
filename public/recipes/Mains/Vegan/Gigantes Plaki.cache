Method
Soak the beans overnight in plenty of water. Drain, rinse, then
place in a pan covered with water. Bring to the boil, reduce the
heat, then simmer for approx 50 mins until slightly tender but not
soft. Drain, then set aside.
Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Heat the olive oil in a large
frying pan, tip in the onion and garlic, then cook over a medium heat
for 10 mins until softened but not browned. Add the tomato purée,
cook for a further min, add remaining ingredients, then simmer for 2-
3 mins. Season generously, then stir in the beans. Tip into a large
ovenproof dish, then bake for approximately 1 hr, uncovered and
without stirring, until the beans are tender. The beans will absorb all
the fabulous flavours and the sauce will thicken. Allow to cool, then
scatter with parsley and drizzle with a little more olive oil to serve.
