# Potato Salad # 

This is an interesting sounding side from [here](https://yupitsvegan.com/vegan-potato-salad).
## Ingredients ## 

- ~900g small red or yellow potatoes, or a combination cut into bite-sized pieces
- 4 kosher dill pickle spears finely chopped
- 2 ribs celery thinly sliced
- ½ red onion, finely chopped 
- ¼ cup/2.5g fresh dill, finely chopped 
- 2 tbsp fresh parsley, finely chopped 
- 2 spring onions, finely chopped with white and light green parts

### For the dressing

- ½ tbsp refined coconut oil (optional) room temperature
- 1 tsp plain non-dairy milk (only if using coconut oil), room temperature
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- 2 tbsp prepared yellow mustard (or use 1 tbsp dijon mustard, plus more to taste)
- 1 tbsp lemon juice

## Method ## 

1. Add the the potatoes to a stock pot and cover by a few inches with water.
2. Add *lots* of salt to the water, and stir. (The writer says My friend remarked “whoa that’s a lot of salt”, and that’s the level you want to be at.)
3. Bring to a boil, and cook for 15-20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender but not falling apart.
4. While the potatoes are cooking, you can start chopping the other ingredients.
5. When done, drain the potatoes and set aside.

### Dressing

1. To make the dressing have a slightly creamier texture and color, use the optional coconut oil and non-dairy milk.
2. Add them to a small bowl along with the olive oil and mustard, and whisk until combined. The mustard will help emulsify the oils together into a creamy mixture, long enough to dress the potatoes. 
3. If not using the optional ingredients then simply whisk the olive oil and mustard together.
4. Add the lemon juice, and season to taste with salt (I started with ¼ tsp) and freshly-ground black pepper to taste, and even red chili flakes if you desire.
5. Stir in a few pinches of each of the chopped herbs.
6. Add the drained potatoes to a mixing bowl with the pickles, celery, red onion, scallions, and the rest of the herbs. 
7. Stir in about half of the dressing. 
8. Set the whole thing in the fridge to cool completely.
9. After the salad is cold, add the rest of the dressing according to your taste (I don't generally use quite all of it).
