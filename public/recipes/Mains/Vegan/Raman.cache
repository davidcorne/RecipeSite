Vegan ramen
Method
Crush the garlic with the back of a big knife, then put it in a
saucepan with the ginger, miso, neri goma, mushrooms, stock and soy.
Bring to a gentle simmer, cover and bubble for 5 mins until the ginger is
soft. Strain into a clean pan and discard everything left in the strainer.
Meanwhile, cook the tofu. Toss it in the cornflour and heat the oil in
a frying pan. Fry for a few mins on each side, being careful as you turn
it that it doesn’t fall apart. Cook the noodles for 1 min less than pack
instructions, so they retain a little bite. Drain and leave in the pan with a
little cooking water so they don’t stick together. 
Add the pak choi and whites of the spring onions to the broth and
gently reheat for 1-2 mins until the greens have just wilted.
Divide the noodles between two deep bowls, ladle over the broth
and veg. Top with the tofu, beansprouts, carrot and ginger matchsticks,
green parts of the spring onions and a drizzle of sesame oil, plus the
other toppings, if you like.
