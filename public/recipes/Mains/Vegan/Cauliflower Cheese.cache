Cauliflower Cheese
# Cauliflower Cheese # 

This is very much based on [this](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/vegan-recipe/hot-n-bubbly-cauliflower-cheese/) but with my own experimentation.

## Ingredients ## 

- 200g cashew nuts, soaked overnight
- 1 head cauliflower
- 1 head broccoli
- 4 vegetable stock cubes
- 4 slices gluten free bread
- 2 onions
- 5 cloves of garlic
- 6 sage leaves
- 2 handfuls of vegan cheese (I used sainsburys free-from grated cheese)
- 4 tablespoons nutritional yeast

## Method ## 

0. Pre-heat the oven to 200Â°C.
1. Dice the onions, and garlic, chiffonade the sage. 
2. Cut the crust off of the bread, and grate to make breadcrumbs.
2. Chop the cauliflower and broccoli into florets.
3. Boil the cauliflower and broccoli, for 8-10 minutes.
4. Drain, but reserve the water.
5. Gently saute the onions, garlic and sage, until soft.
5. Add the soaked cashew nuts, sauted onion mixture to a food processor.
6. Add the stock cubes, nutritional yeast, and a handful of cheese to the mixture, and blend.
7. Add the reserved cooking water to this and continue to blend until a smooth consistency is reached.
8. Place the cauliflower and broccoli into a deep dish, and cover with the sauce.
9. Top with the rest of the cheese, and then the breadcrumbs.
10. Cook in the oven for 30-40 minutes, or until the breadcrumb crust goes golden brown.
