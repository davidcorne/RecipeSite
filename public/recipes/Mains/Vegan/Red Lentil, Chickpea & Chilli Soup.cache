Red lentil, chickpea & chilli
soup
Method
Heat a large saucepan and dry-fry the cumin seeds and chilli
flakes for 1 min, or until they start to jump around the pan and
release their aromas. Add the oil and onion, and cook for 5 mins.
Stir in the lentils, stock and tomatoes, then bring to the boil. Simmer
for 15 mins until the lentils have softened.
Whizz the soup with a stick blender or in a food processor until
it is a rough purée, pour back into the pan and add the chickpeas.
Heat gently, season well and stir in the coriander. Finish with a
dollop of yogurt and coriander leaves.
