J. KENJI LÓPEZ-ALT
A thick, creamy, tangy, gooey vegan nacho sauce made with supermarket staples.
Perfect for dipping or topping nachos, baked potatoes, veggie burgers, or macaroni and
cheese.
Note: For the best, smoothest results, use a high-powered blender (such as a Vitamix or
Blendtec) and press mixture through a chinois.

1.Melt shortening in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add onions,
garlic, and jalapeños and cook, stirring, until completely softened
but not browned, about 4 minutes. Add cumin, paprika, garlic
powder, and chipotle (with sauce). Cook, stirring, until fragrant and
mixture starts to sizzle, about 1 minute.
2.Add potatoes and cashews and cook, stirring, until cashews are
lightly toasted, about 2 minutes. Add water and almond milk. Bring
to a boil, reduce to a bare simmer, and cook, stirring frequently,
until potatoes are fully tender, about 10 minutes.
3.Transfer mixture to the jar of a high-powered blender (see note).
Add hot sauce, jalapeño pickling liquid, and a pinch of salt. Start on
low speed and slowly increase speed to high. Blend on high speed
until completely smooth, about 2 minutes, adding water a few
drops at a time as necessary to thin to desired consistency.
Season to taste with more salt.
4.Press mixture through a chinois (see note), using the bottom of a
ladle to get it through. Cheese sauce can be stored in the
refrigerator in a sealed container for up to 1 week. To reheat,
microwave in 30 second increments, stirring in between, or reheat
in a small pan on the stovetop, stirring constantly, and adding extra
water to loosen sauce as necessary.
