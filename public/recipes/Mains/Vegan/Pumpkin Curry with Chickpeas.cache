Pumpkin curry with chickpeas
Method
Heat the oil in a saut√© pan, then gently fry the curry paste with
the onions, lemongrass, cardamom and mustard seed for 2-3 mins
until fragrant. Stir the pumpkin or squash into the pan and coat in
the paste, then pour in the stock and coconut milk. Bring everything
to a simmer, add the chickpeas, then cook for about 10 mins until
the pumpkin is tender. The curry can now be cooled and frozen for
up to 1 month.
Squeeze the juice of one lime into the curry, then cut the other
lime into wedges to serve alongside. Just before serving, tear over
mint leaves, then bring to the table with the lime wedges and warm
naan breads.
