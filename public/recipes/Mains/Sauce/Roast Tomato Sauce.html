# Roast Tomato Sauce # 

## Ingredients ## 

- 1kg ripe medium tomatoes, halved
- 4 garlic cloves, roughly chopped
- 2 tsp caster sugar
- 2 tbsp sun-dried tomato puré
- 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- Handful fresh basil leaves, torn

## Method ## 

1. Preheat the oven to 190°C/fan170°C/ gas 5. Spread the tomatoes out, cut-sideup, in a large roasting tin. You may need to use 2 tins if they won’t fit in a single layer. Press the chopped garlic pieces into the tomato flesh to submerge slightly, sprinkle with sugar, salt and pepper and dot with sun-dried tomato purée. 
2. Drizzle with olive oil and roast for about 1 hour, until soft and slightly charred in places.
3. Scatter with the basil leaves, crushing the tomatoes down with a fork as you do to form a sauce. Cool and keep, covered, in the fridge for up to 4 days or freeze (see top tips). 

## Top tips ##

- If you prefer a more refined sauce, use a stick blender or a food processor to whizz the cooked tomatoes until smooth.
- Give the sauce a Middle Eastern flavour by adding a broken cinnamon stick to the tomatoes before cooking and replacing the basil with fresh coriander.
- When choosing, look for firmish, fragrant tomatoes with an intense colour.
- Tomatoes still attached to the vine often have a sweeter flavour. Roast a mixture of cherry, medium, plum and vine to give a great flavoured sauce.
