Thai-Style Steamed Trout
1.
2.
Thai-style steamed fish
Method
Nestle the fish fillets side by side on a large square of foil and
scatter the ginger, garlic, chilli and lime zest over them. Drizzle the
lime juice on top and then scatter the pieces of pak choi around and
on top of the fish. Pour the soy sauce over the pak choi and loosely
seal the foil to make a package, making sure you leave space at the
top for the steam to circulate as the fish cooks.
Steam for 15 minutes. (If you havenâ€™t got a steamer, put the
parcel on a heatproof plate over a pan of gently simmering water,
cover with a lid and steam.)
