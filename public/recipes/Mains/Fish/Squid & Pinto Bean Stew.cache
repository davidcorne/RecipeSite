Squid & pinto bean stew with
garlic toasts
Method
Drain the pinto beans, rinse in water and put in a large
saucepan. Add the halved onion, whole carrot and halved celery
sticks, then cover with water and add the bay leaf. Bring to the boil,
skim off any scum, turn down the heat and simmer until totally
tender, for around 1 hr. When done, drain, discarding the bay leaf
and cooked veg. Put the beans to one side until ready to use.
Meanwhile, heat a flameproof casserole dish with 2 tbsp oil.
Toss in the remaining onion, carrot, celery and the chopped garlic.
Fry gently for 15 mins until the vegetables are tender. Stir through
the squid, tomato purée and thyme sprig. Cook for a min or two,
then pour over the passata and chicken stock. Bring to the boil, turn
down the heat, pop on the lid and simmer for 45 mins, stirring
occasionally. Take off the lid and cook down for 30 mins.
