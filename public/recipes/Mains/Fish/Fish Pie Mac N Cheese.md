- 180g frozen peas
- handful of parsley, chopped

1. Pour the milk into a large pan and add the flour and butter.

1. Tip the pasta into the sauce and add half the fish, stir everything together then tip into a large baking dish.
1. Top with the rest of the fish, pushing it into the pasta a little, then scatter with the remaining cheese.
1. Bake for 30 mins until golden, then serve with salad, if you like.
1. Can be chilled and eaten within three days or frozen for up to a month.
    1. Defrost in the fridge, then reheat in a microwave or oven until piping hot.

## Notes

- This is a very good child friendly recipe.
- This works well with gluten-free pasta and flour.
- This works well with oat milk, and I think would work well with any milk substitute.
- Doubled the recipe fills a large pan and serves 4 adults and 2 kids with a few leftovers.
