Method
Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Arrange the potato and pepper
slices on a large non-stick baking tray. Drizzle over 1 tbsp oil and
scatter with the rosemary, a pinch of salt and a good grinding of pepper.
Toss everything together well and roast for 25 mins, turning over
halfway through, until the potatoes are golden and crisp at the edges.
Arrange the fish fillets on top and scatter over the olives. Place a
couple of lemon slices on top of the fish and drizzle with the remaining
