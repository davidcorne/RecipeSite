You'll also need

medium saucepan with a lid

measuring spoons

1 Tip the sushi rice into a medium saucepan, cover with 200ml water and add a pinch of salt. Put the pan on the hob and turn the heat to high. Wait for the water to boil, then reduce the heat to very low, cover the pan with a lid and leave to gently

cook for 15 mins.

2 After 15 mins turn off the heat, fluff up the rice with a fork, then return the lid to the pan and leave for another 5 mins - the rice will continue to cook. After 5 mins, check the rice is cooked - it should have absorbed all the water and be soft, but not mushy. Stir the sugar and vinegar through the rice, cover with the lid again and keep warm while

you prepare the other ingredients. 3 Fill a small pan halfway with water, put it on the hob and bring the water to a gentle boil. Add the edamame beans, cook for 3 mins, then drain.

4 Peel the carrot and discard the outer skin, then keep peeling to create lots of carrot ribbons.

5 Thinly slice the radishes. Cut the cucumber into batons, then thinly slice them lengthways.

6 With your hands, break the salmon into small pieces. Be sure to look out for any bones and throw these away.

7 Divide the warm rice between two bowls and arrange the other ingredients on top, then top with the soy sauce and sesame seeds, and add a few pieces of sushi ginger, if you like.
