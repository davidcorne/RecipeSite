# Fish Chowder Recipe # 

This is a very good recipe based on the [Serious Eats Chowder](https://www.seriouseats.com/easy-creamy-one-pot-weeknight-salmon-chowder-recipe). My main changes are swapping fish stock for clam juice, and swapping the amounts of clam juice and milk.

## Ingredients ## 

- 225g pound salt pork or bacon, cut into ½-inch pieces
- 2 tablespoons water (30ml)
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped (about 8 ounces; 225g)
- 2 large ribs celery, finely chopped (about 6 ounces; 170g)
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 750ml fish stock
- 350ml whole milk
- 1 pound russet or Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cut into ½-inch cubes (450g)
- 1 bay leaf
- 350-450g boneless, skinless fish scraps, such as salmon, cod, or halibut, cut into chunks (prawns also work well)
- Minced fresh herbs such as parsley, dill, or chives, for serving
- Hot sauce, for serving
- Crackers, for serving

## Method ## 

1. Combine salt pork or bacon and water in a heavy-bottomed stock pot or Dutch oven over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until water has evaporated and pork has begun to brown and crisp in spots, about 8 minutes.
1. Add onion, and celery. Season gently with salt and pepper and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are softened but not browned, about 4 minutes longer.
1. Add flour and cook, stirring, until no pockets of raw flour remain.
1. Stir in fish stock, followed by milk.
1. Add potatoes and bay leaf and bring to a simmer.
1. Simmer chowder, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are fully tender, about 15 minutes.
1. Stir in fish chunks and simmer just until cooked through, about 3 minutes.
1. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
1. Serve immediately, garnished with minced fresh herbs, hot sauce, and crackers.
