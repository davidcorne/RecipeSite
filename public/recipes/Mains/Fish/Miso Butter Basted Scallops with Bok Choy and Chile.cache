INSTRUCTIONS
Cook's Note: We recommend buying "dry” scallops, which don't have chemical additives and taste
better than "wet." Dry scallops will also sear much faster and develop a better crust. Dry scallops will
look ivory or pinkish; wet scallops are bright white. Scallops may not be labeled dry or wet, so be sure
to ask your ퟷကshmonger. Serve with steamed white rice. We’ve tested this recipe using both gram
measurements and traditional U.S. volume and weight measurements so you get to pick the one that
works best for you.  
340 g large sea scallops, tendons removed 
1.5 g kosher salt 
56 g unsalted butter, softened 
56 g white miso
Line large plate with paper towels. Sprinkle scallops evenly on both sides
with salt. Transfer scallops to prepared plate and place second layer of paper
towels on top. Refrigerate scallops and allow moisture to release onto paper
towels, at least 10 or up to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, using fork, thoroughly
combine butter and miso in small bowl. Transfer 70 grams (5 tablespoons)
miso butter to second small bowl.

14 g vegetable oil 
450 g bok choy, stalks cut into ¾-inch pieces and leaves cut into 2-inch
pieces 
Scallion whites 
Minced chile 
6 g garlic (1 clove), minced 
6 g fresh ginger, grated 
10 g lemon juice 
Kosher salt 
60 g sake 
15 g rice vinegar
Heat 14 grams oil in 12-inch skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add bok
choy and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly wilted, about 1 minute. Stir
in scallion whites, minced chile, garlic, and ginger and cook until fragrant,
about 30 seconds. Transfer bok choy to medium bowl; stir in lemon juice and
season with salt to taste. Return pan to high heat and add sake and vinegar;
cook until reduced by half, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to low, add 70 grams
(5 tablespoons) miso butter, and whisk until sauce is smooth and emulsiퟷကed,
about 30 seconds. Pour sauce over bok choy in bowl and toss to combine;
cover to keep warm. Rinse skillet and wipe dry with paper towels.

28 g vegetable oil
Blot scallops thoroughly dry with fresh paper towels. Heat remaining 28
grams oil in skillet over high heat until smoking. Add scallops in single layer,
៹ကat side down, arranging them in ring near exterior of skillet, and cook,
tilting pan and moving scallops occasionally to distribute oil, until well
browned, 1½ to 2 minutes.

Reduce heat to low. Slide scallops to back of skillet, opposite handle, and
add remaining miso butter to front of skillet. Using tongs, ៹ကip scallops. Once
butter has melted, tilt skillet so butter pools near base of handle. Using metal
spoon, continuously spoon butter over scallops, concentrating on areas
where crust is less browned. Baste until sides of scallops are ퟷကrm and
centers register 115 degrees F/46 degrees C, about 30 seconds. Remove
skillet from heat and transfer scallops to large plate.

Scallion greens 
Chile rings
Divide bok choy between plates. Divide scallops between plates, seared side
up, and spoon browned butter in pan over top. Sprinkle with scallion greens
and chile rings. Serve.
