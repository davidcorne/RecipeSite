Sea bass with sizzled ginger, chilli
& spring onions
Method
Season the fish with salt and pepper, then slash the skin 3 times.
Heat a heavy-based frying pan and add 1 tbsp oil. Once hot, fry the fish,
skin-side down, for 5 mins or until the skin is very crisp and golden. The
fish will be almost cooked through. Turn over, cook for another 30 secs-
1 min, then transfer to a serving plate and keep warm. Youâ€™ll need to fry
the fish in 2 batches.
Heat the remaining oil, then fry the ginger, garlic and chillies for
about 2 mins until golden. Take off the heat and toss in the spring
onions. Splash the fish with a little soy sauce and spoon over the
contents of the pan.
