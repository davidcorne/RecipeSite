# Fish Tacos # 

This is a fish taco recipe from [Marcus Waering](http://thetaste.ie/wp/fish-tacos-recipe-marcus-wareing/) which is a favorite of the Great British Cookbook Club.

## Ingredients ## 

- 4 skinless cod fillets or other firm- fleshed white fish (about 150g per portion), each cut into 3 pieces
- 100g rock salt (optional)
- vegetable oil, for shallow-frying
- 50–60g plain flour, for dusting
- 3 eggs, beaten
- 200g panko breadcrumbs
- 12 small, soft tacos, or 6 large tortillas 2 Baby Gem lettuces, washed and finely shredded
- 1 bunch of round radishes, washed and grated

### Pickled chilli and onion rings

- 50g caster sugar
- 1 tbsp yellow mustard seeds 100ml white wine vinegar
- 1 onion, finely sliced into rings
- 1 green chilli, deseeded if you wish, finely chopped
- ½ bunch of coriander, leaves finely chopped

### Harissa cream

- 160g sour cream
- 1 tbsp good-quality mayonnaise
- 1 tsp harissa paste

## Method ## 

1. To make the pickled chilli and onion rings, place the caster sugar in a pan with the mustard seeds and 100ml water.
2. Bring to the boil then reduce the heat and simmer until the sugar has dissolved.
3. Remove from the heat, add the vinegar and mix well.
3. Add the onion rings and chopped chilli.
4. Cover and set aside at room temperature for a minimum of 2 hours.
5. Cover the fish with rock salt, if using, and leave for 10 minutes, then thoroughly rinse off the salt under cold running water and pat the fish dry with kitchen paper.
6. Mix the sour cream, mayonnaise and harissa paste together in a bowl, cover and chill until ready to serve.
7. Pour enough vegetable oil into a large, deep frying pan to come up to approximately 1cm and place on medium heat (160°C on a thermometer).
8. Place the flour, beaten eggs and panko breadcrumbs in three separate bowls. Coat the fish pieces in the flour, dust off the excess, then dip them in the beaten egg and finish them with a coating of the panko breadcrumbs.
9. To fry the fish, place the pieces gently in the hot oil in batches for 4–6 minutes until golden and cooked through.
10. Carefully remove each piece of fish from the pan with a large slotted spoon and place on sheets of kitchen paper to absorb excess oil.
11. Heat a dry frying pan and toast each taco for 10 seconds on each side, to warm them through.
12. Add the coriander to the pickled onion rings.
13. Add 2 pieces of fish to each taco, top with shredded lettuce, grated radish, pickled chilli and onion and harissa sour cream.
