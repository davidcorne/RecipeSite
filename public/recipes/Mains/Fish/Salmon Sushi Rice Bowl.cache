# Salmon Sushi Rice Bowl

This is a BBC Good Food magazine recipe from June 2022.

We've topped this simple sushi bowl with salmon, but you could use prawns, tuna or cooked chicken. instead, if you like.

## Ingredients ## 

- 150g sushi rice
- 200ml water
- pinch of caster sugar
- 1 tbsp rice vinegar
- 120g frozen edamame beans
- 1 large carrot
- handful of radishes
- Â¼ cucumber
- 2 cooked skinless salmon fillets
- 1-2 tbsp low-salt soy sauce
- 1 tsp toasted sesame seeds
- few pieces of sushi ginger (optional).

## Method ## 

1. Tip the sushi rice into a medium saucepan, cover with 200ml water and add a pinch of salt.
1. Put the pan on the hob and turn the heat to high. Wait for the water to boil, then reduce the heat to very low, cover the pan with a lid and leave to gently cook for 15 mins.
1. After 15 mins turn off the heat, fluff up the rice with a fork, then return the lid to the pan and leave for another 5 mins - the rice will continue to cook. 
1. After 5 mins, check the rice is cooked - it should have absorbed all the water and be soft, but not mushy.
1. Stir the sugar and vinegar through the rice, cover with the lid again and keep warm while you prepare the other ingredients.
1. Fill a small pan halfway with water, put it on the hob and bring the water to a gentle boil. Add the edamame beans, cook for 3 mins, then drain.
1. Peel the carrot and discard the outer skin, then keep peeling to create lots of carrot ribbons.
1. Thinly slice the radishes.
1. Cut the cucumber into batons, then thinly slice them lengthways.
1. With your hands, break the salmon into small pieces. Be sure to look out for any bones and throw these away.
1. Divide the warm rice between two bowls and arrange the other ingredients on top, then top with the soy sauce and sesame seeds, and add a few pieces of sushi ginger, if you like.
