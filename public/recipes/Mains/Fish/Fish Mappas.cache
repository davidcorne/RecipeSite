Method
Put a large saucepan of water on to boil and cook the rice following
pack instructions. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large, wide saucepan
over a medium heat and add the onions. Cook for 5-10 mins until
softened and starting to colour. Add the garlic and tomatoes, and fry for
2 mins. Add the curry paste, fry for 2 mins more, then pour in the
coconut milk and bring to the boil.
Add the fish to the pan and simmer gently for 5-8 mins until just
cooked through. Turn off the heat. Sprinkle the coriander over the curry
and serve with the rice.
