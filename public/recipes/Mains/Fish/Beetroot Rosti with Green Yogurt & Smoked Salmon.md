## Ingredients ## 

- 600g beetroot, trimmed, peeled and coarsely grated
- 400g potatoes, coarsely grated
- 2 tbsp olive oil

- ½ bunch of parsley
- pinch of ground cumin

## Method ## 

### Make the Rosti

1. Toss the beetroot and potato with a large pinch of salt, tip into a colander in the sink, and leave to drain for 30 mins.
1. Transfer to a clean tea towel and squeeze out any excess liquid.
1. Heat half the oil in a frying pan and fry the onion for 5 mins.
1. Add the grated veg and fry for 10 mins more until just soft.
1. Remove from the heat and cool slightly.
1. Combine with 1 egg and the flour, season and form into eight patties.

### For the herb yogurt

1. Tip everything into a food processor with a pinch of sea salt, and blitz until smooth.

### Cooking the Rosti

1. Heat the butter and remaining oil in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat, and fry the rosti for 4-5 mins on each side until crisp and cooked through.
1. Put on a baking tray and keep warm in a low oven.

### Poaching the Eggs

1. Bring a pan of lightly salted water to a simmer with the vinegar.
1. Stir to create a whirlpool.
1. Crack 1 egg into a cup, wait until the whirlpool has almost subsided, then tip in the egg.
1. Poach for 2-3 mins, remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.
1. Repeat with the other eggs.

### Serving

Serve the rosti with the herb yogurt, poached eggs, smoked salmon and some extra dill.
