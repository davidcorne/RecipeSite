Lemon cod with basil bean
mash
Method
Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Put the tomatoes onto a
baking tray, rub with a little oil and some seasoning, then roast for 5
mins until the skins are starting to split. Add the fish to the tray, top
with most of the lemon zest and some more seasoning, then drizzle
with a little more oil. Roast for 8-10 mins until the fish flakes easily.
Meanwhile, cook the beans in a pan of boiling water for 3 mins
until just tender. Drain, then tip into a food processor with the rest of
the oil, garlic, basil stalks, lemon juice and stock, then pulse to a
thick, slightly rough purée. Season to taste.
Divide the tomatoes and mash between two plates, top with the
cod, then scatter with basil leaves and the remaining lemon zest to
serve.
