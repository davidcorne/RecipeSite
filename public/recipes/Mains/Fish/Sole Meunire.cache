Method
Check the fish for small bones and pull any out with tweezers.
In a large shallow bowl, season the flour with a little salt and black
pepper. Toss the fish in the flour, coating well, and shake off any
excess.
Heat the oil in a large frying pan. Add the fish and cook, skin-
side down, for 2 mins. Use a fish slice or large spatula to turn, then
cook the other side for 1-2 mins until golden.
Remove the fish to a warmed plate, then season. Wipe out the
pan with kitchen paper. Return the pan to the heat, then add the
butter. Heat until it melts and begins to turn a light brown, then mix
in the lemon juice and capers, if using. Swirl in the pan for a few
secs, return fish to the pan and spoon over any juices. Serve
immediately.
