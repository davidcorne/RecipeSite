Superhealthy salmon burgers
Method
Tip the salmon into a food processor with the paste, ginger, soy
and chopped coriander. Pulse until roughly minced. Tip out the mix
and shape into 4 burgers. Heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan, then
fry the burgers for 4-5 mins on each side, turning until crisp and
cooked through.
Meanwhile, use a swivel peeler to peel strips of carrot and
cucumber into a bowl. Toss with the vinegar and sugar until the
sugar has dissolved, then toss through the coriander leaves. Divide
the salad between 4 plates. Serve with the burgers and rice.
