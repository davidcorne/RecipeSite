# Basic Gluten Free Pizza Dough # 

This is a gluten free pizza recipe from [here](https://glutenfreeonashoestring.com/gf-pizza-dough/).

## Ingredients ## 

420g all purpose gluten free flour, plus more for sprinkling*
2¼ teaspoons xanthan gum (omit if your blend already contains it)
9g instant yeast
6g sugar
9g kosher salt
265ml ounces warm water
65g extra-virgin olive oil (plus more for brushing)

## Method ## 

### Dough

1. In the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or your food processor fitted with the metal blade, place the flour, xanthan gum, yeast, and sugar, and whisk to combine with a separate, handheld whisk.
1. Add the salt, and whisk again to combine well.
1. Add the water and olive oil, and mix on medium speed in your stand mixer or pulse in your food processor until the dough begins to come together.
1. Turn the mixer to high speed or your food processor on and process until the dough is no longer a ball but has begun to appear whipped.
1. Transfer the dough to an oiled container with a tight-fitting lid or a greased bowl, spray lightly with cooking oil spray, and cover tightly.
1. Place in a warm, draft-free area to rise until it’s about 150% of its original volume (about an hour), or refrigerate the dough for up to 3 days.

### Making Pizza

1. When you’re ready to make the pizza, place a pizza stone or overturned rimmed baking sheet in the oven and preheat it to 205°C.
    1. If you’ve refrigerated the dough, work with it straight from the refrigerator.
    1. If you haven’t, place the tightly sealed dough in the refrigerator to chill for at least 15 minutes before working with it, as it’s easiest to work with when it’s chilled.
1. To make pizza, place the dough on a lightly floured surface and sprinkle the top lightly with a bit more flour.
1. Knead the dough a bit until it’s smoother, then divide it into two equal portions.
1. Cover the unused portion so it doesn’t dry out and roll the other half on the floured surface with a rolling pin, moving the dough frequently to prevent sticking.
1. Sprinkle very lightly with additional flour as necessary.
1. Create a smooth edge around the perimeter of the dough by pressing the edges with one hand toward the palm of your other.
1. Transfer the dough to a large piece of unbleached parchment paper and brush the top of the dough generously with olive oil.
1. Using a pizza peel or other flat surface like a cutting board, transfer the dough to the pizza peel or baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake it plain for 5 to 7 minutes, or  until the crust has begun to crisp on the underside.
1. Remove the crust from the oven. At this point, the parbaked crust can be cooled completed, wrapped tightly and frozen for at least one month. Simply defrost at room temperature, and then continue with the recipe as written.
1. To continue preparing the dough, add your favorite toppings to the parbaked crust, and return the pizza to the hot oven until any cheese is melted and the edges have browned and puffed (another 5 to 7 minutes). Allow to set for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.
