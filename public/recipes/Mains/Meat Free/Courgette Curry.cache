# Courgette Curry

This is a BBC Good Food magazine recipe from June 2022. Scoop out the seeds before slicing and frying the courgettes to achieve a firmer texture in this curry. Nothing is wasted - the seeds bulk out the sauce when added towards the end of cooking.

## Ingredients ## 

- 3 medium courgettes
- 2-3 tbsp sunflower oil
- 1 red onion, halved and finely sliced
- 1-2 red chillies (depending on your preference), finely chopped
- 40g ginger, peeled and finely grated 4 garlic cloves, finely grated
- 2 tsp garam masala
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 400g can chickpeas, drained
- 400g can chopped tomatoes
- 400g can coconut milk cooked basmati rice, to serve

## Method ## 

1. Trim the ends of the courgettes, halve them lengthways and, using a teaspoon, scrape out the watery seeds in the centre (it's fine if you don't get all of them).
1. Roughly slice the courgette halves, then roughly chop the seeds and reserve for later.
1. Heat 2 tbsp oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat and fry the sliced courgettes until golden, about 8-10 mins.
1. Remove from the pan, leaving the oil behind, then add the onion and a further tablespoon of oil if necessary, along with a good pinch each of salt and pepper. 
1. Fry for 6-8 mins until soft and just starting to turn a light brown, then tip in the chillies, ginger and garlic, and cook for 2 mins until starting to soften. 
1. Stir in the spices and cook for another 30 seconds.
1. Scatter in the chickpeas and pour in the tomatoes, coconut milk and reserved courgette seeds.
1. Simmer over a medium-low heat for 10 mins before adding the courgettes back to the pan and cooking for a further 8-10 mins.
1. Serve with basmati rice and sides of your choice.
