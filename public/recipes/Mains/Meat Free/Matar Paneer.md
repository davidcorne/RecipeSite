## Ingredients ##
- 1 tablespoon oil 15 ml, use oil of choice
- 2 whole green cardamom
- 4-5 black peppercorns
- ½ teaspoon cumin seeds
- 1 medium onion 160 grams, roughly chopped
- 1 inch ginger 13 grams, chopped
- 4 large garlic cloves 14 grams, chopped
- 1-2 green chilies roughly chopped, adjust to taste
- 3 medium tomatoes 400 grams, roughly chopped
- 10 whole cashews
- 1 tablespoon ghee
- 1 bay leaf
- ¼ teaspoon red chili powder or to taste
- ¾ teaspoon coriander powder
- ¼ teaspoon garam masala + more to sprinkle
- ¼-½ teaspoon cumin powder
- ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder
- ¾ teaspoon salt or to taste
- ½ teaspoon sugar optional
- 2 tablespoons plain yogurt
- 1.25 cups water
- 250 grams paneer
- ½-¾ cup green peas I used frozen soaked in warm water for 5 minutes
- cilantro to garnish

## Method ##

1. Before you start with the recipe: If using store bought paneer, soak in warm water for 20 minutes before you begin the recipe.
2. Also soak frozen green peas in warm water for 10 minutes before using in the recipe.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a pot/pan on medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add 2 green cardamoms, 4-5 peppercorns and ½ teaspoon cumin seeds. Saute until the spices are fragrant and the cumin seeds sizzle for few seconds.
3. Then add the onion, ginger, garlic and green chili. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes until the onions are light brown and soft.
4. Then add the chopped tomatoes and 10 whole cashews and mix. Cover the pot with a lid and let it cook for 6 to 7 minutes until the tomatoes are really soft.
5. Remove pan from heat and let the mixture cool down a bit. Once it has cooled down a little, transfer to a blender and grind to a smooth paste. Set it aside.
6. Heat a tablespoon of ghee (or oil) in a pan on medium heat. Add bay leaf and then add ¼ teaspoon red chili powder.
7. Saute for few seconds until you see a nice bright red color.
8. Then add in the prepared onion-tomato paste back into the pan and mix well.
9. Add ¾ teaspoon coriander powder, ¼ teaspoon garam masala, ¼ teaspoon cumin powder, ¼ teaspoon turmeric, ¾ teaspoon salt (or to taste) and ½ teaspoon sugar (if using). Mix well and cook the spices for one minute.
10. Whisk in 2 tablespoons plain yogurt, stirring continuously until it mixes well.
11. Then add water to the pan and let it come to a boil.
12. Add the paneer cubes and green peas peas. Stir and then cover the pan. Let it simmer for 6 to 7 minutes on medium heat.
13. Sprinkle some garam masala on top.
14. Garnish with cilantro and serve matar paneer with some warm rotis or parathas!

## Notes
These are the things I did differently. Admittedly, I made quite a few changes but the base recipe is very much there.

- I used Halloumi instead of paneer (some may think this is a food crime, but I had lots of halloumi in and it worked
really well). Note, I didn't fry the halloumi first which some sites recommend and it was very paneer like.
- Rather than make a base gravy from this recipe, I used some that I had on hand already from <a
  href="/public/recipes/Other/Sauce/Curry Base Gravy.html">this recipe</a> with added cashew nuts.
- I added some more vegetables for more texture; sliced onions and tomatoes I fried before the spices then removed and
added back in at the same time as the cheese.
