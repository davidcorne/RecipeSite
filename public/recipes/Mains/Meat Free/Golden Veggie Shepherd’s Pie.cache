Golden veggie shepherd’s pie
Method
To make the sauce, heat the butter in a pan, then gently fry the
onions, carrots, celery and garlic for 15 mins until soft and golden. Turn
up the heat, add the mushrooms, then cook for 4 mins more. Stir in the
herbs, then add the lentils. Pour over the wine and stock – it’s important
that you do not season with salt at this stage. Simmer for 40-50 mins
until the lentils are very soft. Now season to taste, take off heat, then
stir in the tomato purée.
While the lentils are cooking, tip the potatoes into a pan of water,
then boil for about 15 mins until tender. Drain well, mash with the butter
and milk, then season with salt and pepper.
To assemble the pies, divide the lentil mixture between all the
dishes that you are using, then top with mash. Scatter over the cheese
and freeze for up to two months (see tips, below) or if eating that day,
heat oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5, then bake for 30 mins until the
topping is golden.
