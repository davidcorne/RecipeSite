# Sticky Miso Aubergine Traybake # 

This is a BBC good food recipe from September 2023.

## Ingredients ## 

- 2 aubergines, halved lengthways
- 2 tsp sesame oil
- 1½ tbsp white miso
- 1 tbsp mirin
- ½ tbsp honey
- 250g pouch cooked brown rice 2 tsp sesame seeds
- 2 spring onions, finely sliced

## Method ## 

1. Heat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan.
1. Score the flesh of the aubergines in a deep criss-cross pattern, being careful not to cut through to the skin.
1. Arrange on a baking tray lined with baking parchment and brush the flesh with the sesame oil.
1. Turn so they're cut-side down, and roast for 15-20 mins until just softening.
1. Meanwhile, combine the miso, mirin, honey and 1 tbsp water.
1. Remove the aubergines from the oven and turn so they're cut-side up, then brush over the miso glaze.
1. Return to the oven for 15-20 mins, or until fully soft and caramelised.
1. Heat the grill to its highest setting and slide the aubergines under for 5 mins until bubbling (watch closely so the parchment doesn't catch).
1. Warm the rice following pack instructions, then top with the aubergines, sesame seeds and spring onions.
