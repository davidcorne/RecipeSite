# Spring Onion Pancake (Cong You Bing) # 

This is a gluten free version of a traditional Chinese side/appetizer. The filling was from [here](https://brightrootskitchen.com/scallion-pancakes-gluten-free/) and the dough was from [here](https://redhousespice.com/spring-onion-pancake/) but with gluten free flour and slightly more water.
 
## Ingredients ## 

### Dough
- 250g gluten free plain flour + extra for dusting
- 190ml boiling water

### Scallion Pancake Filling
- 1 bunch spring onion, chopped
- 1 clove garlic, finely chopped
- ½ jalepeno, chopped and seeds removed leave the seeds in if you want it spicy
- ¼ tsp ground Sichuan pepper, or Chinese five-spice powder
- 1 tsp olive oil

## Method ## 

1. Put the flour into a heatproof bowl, pour in boiling water.
2. Stir with a pair of chopsticks or a fork until the flour turns into small lumps and no more water can be seen.
3. When cool enough to handle, knead the mixture into a soft, smooth dough. Leave to rest for 30 mins (see note 1).
4. While that's resting, make the filling by mixing it all together in a bowl.
2. In a separate bowl stir together all of the pancake filling ingredients.
3. Sprinkle a counter or durable cutting board with a little flour (to keep the dough from sticking).
4. Roll out the dough into a large rectangle about ½ inch thick.
5. Evenly spread the filling onto the dough.
6. Roll up the dough into a cylinder.
7. Cut rounds from the cylinder and then squash them down into pancake shapes.
8. Heat a tbsp of oil over a medium heat.
9. Fry each of them till each side is golden brown, about 3-4 minutes.

## Notes

1. The flour and water ratio may vary slightly depending on the brand. Adjust accordingly. The finished dough should be soft but not sticky.
2. These go really well with sweet chilli sauce, there is an "additive dipping sauce" on [this recipe](https://brightrootskitchen.com/scallion-pancakes-gluten-free/) but we weren't big fans of them.
