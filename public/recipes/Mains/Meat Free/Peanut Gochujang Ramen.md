## Ingredients ## 

### For the crispy gochujang garlic tofu

- 285g firm or extra firm tofu pressed for at least 15 minutes and sliced into rectangles or cubes or whatever shape you like
- 2 teaspoons soy sauce or tamari
- 2 teaspoons gochujang
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch or tapioca starch

### For the peanut butter ramen

- 1 teaspoon oil optional
- 170g sliced mushrooms such as white or cremini or portabella
- 2 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste or you can mince or blend 1 inch of ginger and 3 cloves of garlic with a few teaspoons water, to make a paste and use
- 3 tablespoons smooth peanut butter
- 1 tablespoon gochujang or other Asian chile sauce
- 1 tablespoon maple syrup
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce or tamari
- 1200ml water or stock
- 170g ramen or thin udon noodles

### For garnish

- lime wedges, green onions, sesame seeds, soft boiled egg

## Method ## 

### Make the gochujang garlic tofu

1. Press and cube the tofu if you haven’t already and add it to a bowl.
1. In a small bowl mix the soy sauce, gochujang, garlic powder, and sesame oil and pour it over the tofu.
1. Toss well to coat.
1. Add 2 teaspoons of the cornstarch and toss well.
1. If the mixture is still somewhat wet then add the rest of the cornstarch and toss well.
1. Then either bake the tofu:
    - transfer the tofu cubes to a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake it at 205°C for 20-25 minutes,
    - or transfer them to a hot wok with a teaspoon of oil and cook them until they are crisp on most of the edges, about 5-6 minutes.

### Make the ramen

1. I use the same wok for making the tofu as well as the ramen.
1. Remove the tofu once crisp from the pot and then make the ramen.
1. Add oil, mushrooms, and a good pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 minutes to brown the mushrooms on some of the edges.
1. Then add the ginger-garlic paste, peanut butter, gochujang, and soy sauce and mix really well.
1. Add ¼ cup of the water or broth and mix in. Mix well to incorporate the peanut butter.
1. Bring the mixture to a boil then gradually add the rest of the broth.
1. Mix and Bring to a good rolling boil, then add your noodles.
1. Press to submerge in the boiling broth, then cook them according to the time on the packaging.
    1. Ramen noodles will cook pretty quickly, within 3-4 minutes, while udon noodles will take around 7-8 minutes.
1. Once the noodles are cooked to your preference, switch off the heat.
1. Taste and adjust salt and flavor. If you want it sweeter then you can add more maple syrup. You can more salt if needed or some black pepper for extra heat.
1. To serve, ladle the broth into your serving bowls. Then transfer some of the noodles with mushrooms to your serving bowls. Top it with the crispy tofu, a squeeze of lime or lemon, lime wedge, green onions, and sesame seeds, and serve.

## Notes

- I made this with rice stick noodles, and they were more absorbant so it wasn't the liquidy dish it should have been.
