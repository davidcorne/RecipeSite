## Ingredients ## 

### Base

- 3 tbsp oil (I used rapeseed oil)
- 1 large onion, diced
- 3 cloves of garlic, diced
- 3 leeks, sliced
- 3 carrots, sliced
- 2 parsnips, sliced
- 3 sweet potatoes, diced
- 750ml vegetable stock
- 6-7 leaves of sage, diced

### White Sauce
- 50g butter
- 50g plain flour (I used gluten free)
- 250ml milk (I used oat milk)
- 50g cheese (I used Lactofree Chedder)

### Topping

- 150g butter
- 150g plain flour (I used gluten free)
- 150g oats
- 50g flaked almonds
- 30g parmesan, grated

## Method ## 

1. Preheat an oven to 200Â°C
1. Heat a large ovenproof pot over a high heat.
2. Heat the 3 tbsp of oil till shimmering.
2. Fry the 3 cloved of garlic and the 1 diced onion till translucent (~8 minutes)
3. Add the 3 leeks, and cook until softened.
4. Add the 3 carrots, 2 parsnips, and 3 sweet potatoes.
5. Fry for 3-4 minutes to get a slight sear on the vegetables.
6. Add the 750 ml of vegetable stock, and the diced sage.
7. Cook for ~10 minutes to soften the vegetables and reduce the liquid content.

### Topping
While the vegetables are softening, make the topping:

1. Add the 150g butter, 150g plain flour, 150g oats in a mixing bowl.
2. Mix roughly by hand, you want a granualar texture not a rolled dough.
3. Carefully mix in the almonds.

### White Sauce
While the vegetables are softening, make a simple white sauce:

1. Heat a medium non-stick pan over a medium heat.
2. Add the 50g of butter, and melt it.
3. Add the 50g of flour. Cook till it foams, about a minute.
4. Gradually add the 250 milk, mixing as you do so it doesn't form lumps.
5. Season with salt and pepper.
6. Add the 50g of cheese, and stir until melted.

### Finishing

1. Add the white sauce into the pot.
2. Allow to encorporate and reduce down for 3-5 minutes. 
3. Check the seasoning at this point, and adjust it as necessary.
4. Take the pot off the heat.
5. Cover in crumble mixture, ensuring it stays granualar and is well covered.
6. Grind some fresh pepper over the crumble.
6. Scatter the 30g of grated parmesan over it.
7. Bake for 30-40 minutes untill the top is golden brown.
