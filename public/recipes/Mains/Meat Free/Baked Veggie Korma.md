# Baked Veggie Korma #

This is a [BBC Good Food](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/baked-veggie-korma) recipe.

## Ingredients ##

- 1 medium cauliflower
- 6 spring onions
- 2 tbsp sunflower or rapeseed oil
- 3 garlic cloves
- ½ jar of korma paste (about 100g)
- 400g can chickpeas
- 150ml coconut or single cream
- 1 vegetable stock cube
- 100g fine green beans
- 50g ground almonds

## Method ##

1. Trim away the root end of the spring onions and peel off the papery skins. Snip the spring onions into small pieces directly into the tin using kitchen scissors.
1. Drizzle the oil over the veg, then season with a pinch of salt and toss everything together with your hands.
1. Put the tin on the middle shelf of the oven. Roast for 15 mins.
1. Peel the skins off the garlic cloves. After 15 mins, carefully remove the tin from the oven using oven gloves. Squeeze the garlic cloves directly into the tin using the garlic crusher .
1. Measure out the curry paste – you can do this using scales or estimate based on the quantity of paste in the jar – if it’s 200g, add roughly half (see tips below). Stir the curry paste and garlic into the veg.
1. Use a can opener to open the can of chickpeas, then tip into a sieve over a bowl to catch the liquid (see below for ideas on how to use this liquid and save on waste). Tip the drained chickpeas into the roasting tin.
1. Pour the coconut cream into the tin, then measure out 450ml water using a measuring jug and add this, too. Crumble over the stock cube.
1. Weigh out the green beans using scales . If they have stalks, snap or carefully cut them off. Add the beans to the roasting tin.
1. Weigh out the ground almonds using scales, then tip them into the tin. Hold the tin steady with one hand while wearing an oven glove and gently stir everything together using a wooden spoon. Return the tin to the oven for 25 mins, then carefully remove from the oven (there will be hot liquid in the tin). Serve the curry with cooked rice or naans and some mango chutney.
