Four Cheese and Chive Quiche
Method
1. Place the flour, salt, lard and butter in a mixing bowl and rub the fat into the
flour until it resembles fine breadcrumbs.
2. Add about 4 tbsp cold water to make a firm dough then wrap in cling film
and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes. While the dough is chilling preheat the
oven to 220°C (fan 200°C, gas mark 7).
3. Roll the pastry out on a floured surface until large enough to line a 23cm
loose-bottomed flan tin. Line the tin with the pastry then line with a circle of
baking paper, then fill with baking beans.
4. Bake for 10 minutes. Take out the paper and beans, then bake for 5
minutes more until pale golden and cooked. Reduce the oven temperature
to 180°c (fan 160°c, gas mark 4).
5. Place the ricotta and the other cheeses in a bowl with the chives and eggs.
6. Beat together until smooth then spread in the pastry case and bake for 20
–25 minutes until just firm, but still has a little wobble in the centre. Allow to
cool and serve at room temperature.
