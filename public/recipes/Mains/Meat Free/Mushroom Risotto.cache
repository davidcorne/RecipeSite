Mushroom risotto
Method
Put the dried mushrooms into a large bowl and pour over 1 litre
boiling water. Soak for 20 mins, then drain into a bowl, discarding
the last few tbsp of liquid left in the bowl. Crumble the stock cube
into the mushroom liquid, then squeeze the mushrooms gently to
remove any liquid. Chop the mushrooms.
Heat the oil in a shallow saucepan or deep frying pan over a
medium flame. Add the onions and garlic, then fry for about 5 mins
until soft. Stir in the fresh and dried mushrooms, season with salt
and pepper and continue to cook for 8 mins until the fresh
mushrooms have softened.
Tip the rice into the pan and cook for 1 min. Pour over the wine
and let it bubble to nothing so the alcohol evaporates. Keep the pan
over a medium heat and pour in a quarter of the mushroom stock.
Simmer the rice, stirring often, until the rice has absorbed all the

simmer and stir - it should start to become creamy, plump and
tender. By the time the final quarter of stock is added, the rice
should be almost cooked.
Continue stirring until the rice is cooked. If the rice is still
undercooked, add a splash of water. Take the pan off the heat, add
the butter and scatter over half the cheese and the parsley. Cover
and leave for a few mins so that the rice can take up any excess
liquid as it cools a bit. Give the risotto a final stir, spoon into bowls
and scatter with the remaining cheese and parsley.
