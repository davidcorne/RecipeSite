# Cauliflower 4 ways # 

This is currently a work in progress for our 12th anniversary. This is what I think the composition should be:

- Cauliflower steak
- Cauliflower purée
- Cauliflower pickles
- Roast cauliflower leaves
- Roast carrot
- Caramelised apple
- Apple gravy

This should look like this:

### Apple Gravy

- Sweat down a diced onion and some garlic
