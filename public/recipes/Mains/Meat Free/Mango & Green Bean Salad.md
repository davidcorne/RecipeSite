# Mango & Green Bean Salad with Honey & Passion Fruit Dressing

This is a BBC Good Food magazine recipe from June 2022. This dressing, with honey for sweetness, plus warming chilli and tangy passion fruit, marries well with the fragrant mangoes and crisp green beans. Look out for seasonal South Asian mangoes many larger supermarkets now sell them at an affordable price.

## Ingredients ## 

- 3 passion fruits
- 1-2 tbsp honey
- 200g fine green beans, trimmed
- 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- 10g ginger, peeled and finely grated
- ½-1 red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped, depending on how much heat you prefer 
- squeeze of lime juice, to taste
- 1kg mangoes
- 1 tbsp chopped coriander
- 1 tbsp mint leaves

## Method ## 

1. Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil over a high heat and cook the green beans for 2 mins until just tender.
1. Drain and rinse under cold running water to halt the cooking process and retain the vibrant colour. Pat dry with kitchen paper and set aside.
1. Halve the passion fruits, scoop the pulp into a small pan and bring to a simmer over a low heat.
1. Cook for 5 mins until the pulp has thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon. 
1. Remove from the heat and press the pulp through a sieve into a small bowl, discarding the seeds.
1. Whisk 1 tbsp honey into the passion fruit purée, followed by the oil, ginger, chilli and lime juice. 
1. Season and taste - you might need to add a little more honey or lime juice. Aim for a balance of sweet, tart and acidic.
1. Slice down through the mangoes along both sides of the stone so you end up with two 'cheeks.
1. Using a tablespoon, scoop the flesh from the skin and cut into 3cm chunks. Scrape and roughly chop any fleshy bits from the stones.
1. Transfer the mango flesh to a shallow serving dish, drizzle with 3 tbsp of the dressing, then gently spoon over the green beans.
1. Stir the coriander into the remaining dressing and pour it over the beans, then scatter with mint and serve.
