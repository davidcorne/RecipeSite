3 passion fruits

1-2 tbsp honey

200g fine green beans, trimmed 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil 10g ginger, peeled and finely grated ½-1 red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped, depending on how much heat you prefer squeeze of lime juice, to taste

1kg mangoes 1 tbsp chopped coriander 1 tbsp mint leaves

1 Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil over a high heat and cook the green beans for 2 mins until just tender. Drain and rinse under cold running water to halt the cooking process and retain the vibrant. colour. Pat dry with kitchen paper and set aside.

2 Halve the passion fruits, scoop the pulp into a small pan and bring to a simmer over a low heat. Cook for 5 mins until the pulp has thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat and press the pulp through a sieve into a small bowl, discarding the seeds.

3 Whisk 1 tbsp honey into the passion fruit purée, followed by the oil, ginger, chilli and lime juice. Season and taste - you might need

to add a little more honey or lime juice. Aim for a balance of sweet, tart and acidic.

4 Slice down through the mangoes along both sides of the stone so you end up with two 'cheeks. Using a tablespoon, scoop the flesh from the skin and cut into 3cm chunks. Scrape and roughly chop any fleshy bits from the stones.

5 Transfer the mango flesh to a shallow serving dish, drizzle with 3 tbsp of the dressing, then gently spoon over the green beans. Stir the coriander into the remaining dressing and pour it over the beans, then scatter with mint and serve.
