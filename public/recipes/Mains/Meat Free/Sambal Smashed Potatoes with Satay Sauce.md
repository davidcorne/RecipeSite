- Handful of Peanuts
- Salt
- Olive Oil

### Sambal

- 4 Red Chillies

### Satay

- ½ tsp Turmeric Powder
- 200ml Coconut Milk
- 2 Tbsp Dark Soy Sauce
- 3 Tbsp Tamarind Paste
- 50g Brown Sugar
- 220g Crunchy Peanut Butter
- Salt
- Vegetable Oil

## Method

1. Heat your oven to 200°C.
1. Bring a large pan of salted water to a boil, then add your potatoes.
1. Simmer for 15 mins until your potatoes are tender, then tip them into a colander and leave to steam dry for a few mins.
1. Bash a clove of garlic with the side of your knife to crush it slightly.
1. Pour a good glug of olive oil into a large baking tray along with your garlic and heat in the oven for 5 mins.

### Satay sauce

1. Mince the garlic and finely chop the shallot.
1. Get a pot on to a medium heat, add 2 tbsps of vegetable oil and your chopped alliums. Fry for a few mins until golden.
1. Add the chilli and turmeric powder, and mix well.
1. Pour in 180ml water, coconut milk and soy sauce.
1. Add in tamarind, sugar, peanut butter and a smashed lemongrass stalk.
1. Bring to a boil, making sure to regularly stir so the bottom of the pot doesn’t burn (this will take around 5 mins).
1. Turn the heat down for the satay sauce and let it simmer for 30 mins.

### Potatoes

1. Using the base of a heavy pan, lightly press down on your cooked potatoes to individually smash them.
1. Add them to your baking tray of hot oil in the oven and sprinkle with a generous pinch of salt. 
1. Roast for 25 mins until the bases are crisp and golden.

### Sambal

1. Roughly chop the garlic, ginger and shallots and finely chop the lemongrass.
1. Blend with 3 tbsp of vegetable oil and transfer to a bowl. This is your garlic paste.
1. Roughly chop the chillies and tomato.
1. Blend your chopped chillies and tomatoes up with chilli flakes and 2 tbsp of vegetable oil.
1. This is your chilli paste.

### Putting it all together

1. Heat your wok with 200ml of vegetable oil on low heat.
1. Add the garlic paste to the wok and cook for 15 mins.
1. Flip your potatoes over after the first 25 mins of roasting and return to the oven for another 25 mins until the potatoes are golden all over.
1. Back to the sambal. Add in the chilli paste, lime juice and sugar to your garlic paste in the pan and cook for another 20 mins on low heat until the oil separates from the paste.
1. Swoosh your satay sauce on a large plate and top with your smashed potatoes. Drizzle some sambal on top, garnish with chopped coriander and crushed peanuts, and tuck in.
