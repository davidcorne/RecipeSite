Courgette pakoras

Moisture isn't usually a friend when deep-frying anything, but here, the natural juices of the courgettes help bind all the ingredients together.

2 medium courgettes (about

500g), grated

1 red onion, grated

175g gram (chickpea) flour 1 red chilli, finely chopped

1 tsp each ground coriander,

cumin and ginger

Â½ small bunch of coriander,

finely chopped sunflower oil, for deep-frying coriander, tamarind or mango chutney, to serve (optional)

1 Put all the ingredients, except the oil, in a bowl with 1/2 tsp salt, and squidge it all together using your hands. The moisture from the courgettes should help bind everything together; you want a sticky but not overly wet mixture.

2 Fill a heavy-based saucepan no more than a third full with oil and set over a medium heat until the oil reaches 180C. If you don't have a cooking thermometer, test it's ready by dropping in a pinch of the pakora mixture. It should sizzle and turn golden brown after 10-20 seconds.

3 Carefully drop tablespoons of the mixture into the oil, using another tablespoon to help you slide them in. Fry for about 2 mins before turning and cooking for a further 2-3 mins until golden brown, crisp and cooked through. Continue frying in batches until all the mixture has been used up.

4 Leave to drain on kitchen paper. You can keep the cooked pakoras warm in a low oven while you make the rest. Serve immediately with your favourite chutney, if you like.
