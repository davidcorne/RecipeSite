SERVES 4 TO 6INGREDIENTS
1head cauliflower (2
pounds)
8tablespoons unsalted
butter, cut into 8 pieces
1leek, white and light
green parts only, halved
lengthwise, sliced thin,
and washed thoroughly
1small onion, halved and
sliced thin
Salt and pepper
4 ½ –
5
cups water
½teaspoon sherry vinegar
3tablespoons minced
fresh chives
INSTRUCTIONS
White wine vinegar may be substituted for the sherry vinegar. Be sure to
thoroughly trim the cauliflower’s core of green leaves and leaf stems,
which can be fibrous and contribute to a grainy texture in the soup.
1. Pull o凢얷 outer leaves of cauliሆᰀower and trim stem. Using
paring knife, cut around core to remove; thinly slice core
and reserve. Cut heaping 1 cup of 1/2-inch ሆᰀorets from head
of cauliሆᰀower; set aside. Cut remaining cauliሆᰀower
crosswise into 1/2-inch thick slices.
2. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in large saucepan over
medium-low heat. Add leek, onion, and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt;
cook, stirring frequently, until leek and onion are softened
but not browned, about 7 minutes.
3. Increase heat to medium-high; add 4 1/2 cups water,
sliced core, and half of sliced cauliሆᰀower; and bring to
simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer gently for
15 minutes. Add remaining sliced cauliሆᰀower, return to
simmer, and continue to cook until cauliሆᰀower is tender
and crumbles easily, 15 to 20 minutes longer.
4. While soup simmers, melt remaining 5 tablespoons butter in 8-inch skillet over medium heat. Add
reserved ሆᰀorets and cook, stirring frequently, until ሆᰀorets are golden brown and butter is browned
and imparts nutty aroma, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and use slotted spoon to transfer
ሆᰀorets to small bowl. Toss ሆᰀorets with vinegar and season with salt to taste. Pour browned butter in
skillet into small bowl and reserve for garnishing.
5. Process soup in blender until smooth, about 45 seconds. Rinse out pan. Return pureed soup to pan
and return to simmer over medium heat, adjusting consistency with remaining water as needed (soup
should have thick, velvety texture but should be thin enough to settle with ሆᰀat surface after being
stirred) and seasoning with salt to taste. Serve, garnishing individual bowls with browned ሆᰀorets,
drizzle of browned butter, and chives and seasoning with pepper to taste.

Most soups made from pureed vegetables
contain cream for a simple reason: to mitigate
the effects of insoluble fiber. All vegetables
have both soluble and insoluble fiber, but only
the soluble kind fully breaks down during
cooking, which contributes viscosity to the
soup. Insoluble fiber remains intact, and the
best that the blades of a blender can do is
break it down into smaller bits. But cauliflower
has a leg up on other vegetables. It’s very low in
overall fiber—and only half of it is insoluble.
This means that cauliflower is easily pureed into
a silky-smooth soup with no cream at all.
Vary Cooking Time to Coax Out Cauliflower’s Different Flavors
While developing our recipe for cauliሆᰀower soup, we discovered that cauliሆᰀower’s ሆᰀavor
changes dramatically depending on how long you cook it. Shorter cooking times bring
out its cabbagelike ሆᰀavors, while longer cooking times turn it nuttier and sweet. Too
much cooking drives o凢얷 all its ሆᰀavor. To bring the full spectrum of possible ሆᰀavors into
our soup, we cooked some of the cauliሆᰀower for 15 minutes and the remainder for 30
minutes.
15 MINUTES: The punchy, cabbagelike taste and the sulfurous odor of a compound
known as carbon disul籨de are dominant.
30 MINUTES: Carbon disul籨de dissipates, allowing the sweeter, nuttier ሆᰀavors of other
substances known as thioureas to break through.
60 MINUTES: After an hour, nearly all the ሆᰀavor has dissipated, leaving the cauliሆᰀower
bland and ሆᰀavorless.
