<title>Vegetarian Toad In The Hole</title>

# Vegetarian Toad in the Hole #

This works especially well with Linda McCartney sausages.

## Ingredients ##

- 6 vegetarian sausages
- Yorkshire pudding batter
- 3 tablespoons flavourless oil (ground nut or sunflower are best)
- 2 cloves pressed/finely chopped garlic
- 2 teaspoons mustard or rosemary, see note

## Method ##

1. If the sausages are frozen, defrost them to room tempreture.
2. Preheat the oven to 200Â°C.
3. Use a large and deep roasting tin (the one I use is about 35 x 25 cm). 
4. Add the oil to the tin and place in the oven for 5 minutes.
5. Add the garlic to the tin for 2 minutes.
6. Add the batter mix to the oil, then immediately arrange the sausages in it. The sausages are placed in last so the oil is used on the batter not the sausages.
7. Return to the oven and cook for 20 minutes.

## Note ##

I find there are two types of vegetarian sausages, meat-like and non meat-like. If you are using meat-like vegetarian sausages mustard works very well with them, but if you are using the less meat-like ones (e.g. Linda McCartney ones) a herb like rosemary works a little better.
