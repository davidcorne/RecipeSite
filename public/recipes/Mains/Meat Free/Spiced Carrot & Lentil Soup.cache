Spiced Carrot & Lentil Soup

Spiced carrot & lentil soup
Method
Heat a large saucepan and dry-fry the cumin seeds and chilli
flakes for 1 min, or until they start to jump around the pan and
release their aromas. Scoop out about half of the seeds with a
spoon and set aside. Add the oil, carrot, lentils, stock and milk to the
pan and bring to the boil. Simmer for 15 mins until the lentils have
swollen and softened.
Whizz the soup with a stick blender or in a food processor until
smooth (or leave it chunky if you prefer). Season to taste and finish
with a dollop of yogurt and a sprinkling of the reserved toasted
spices. Serve with warmed naan breads.
