## Ingredients ##

- 1 cauliflower (about 750g)

## Method ##


### Make Bases

1. Heat oven to 200°C/180°C fan.
1. Remove the leaves from the cauliflower and trim the stalk end, then cut into chunks.
1. Blitz half the cauliflower in a food processor until finely chopped, like rice.
1. Transfer to a bowl and repeat with the remaining half.
1. Tip all the cauliflower in a bowl, cover with cling film and microwave on High for 5-6 mins until softened.
1. Tip onto a clean tea towel and leave to cool a little.
1. Once cool enough to handle, scrunch up the tea towel and squeeze as much liquid as you can out of the cauliflower, then transfer to a clean bowl.
1. Stir in the ground almonds, egg, oregano and plenty of seasoning.
1. Line a baking tray with baking parchment and grease with oil.
1. Mound the cauliflower mix into the centre of the tray, then use a spoon and your hands to spread out into a 30cm round.
1. Make it a little thicker at the edges to create a ‘crust’.
1. Bake for 15-18 mins until golden brown and starting to crisp a little at the edges.
1. Once the cauliflower base is cooked, set aside to cool a little.

### Cook Bases

1. Turn the oven up to 220°C.
1. Spread the tomato sauce over the base, add toppings.
1. Scatter over the chilli flakes and return to the oven for 10-12 mins.
1. Before serving, shave over a little more cheese and scatter with the remaining basil leaves.
