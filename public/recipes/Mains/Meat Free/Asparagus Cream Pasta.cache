Asparagus cream pasta
Method
To prepare the asparagus, cut off and discard the woody ends, then
neatly cut the tips away from the stalks. Keep the tips and stalks
separate. In a small saucepan bring the cream and garlic to the boil.
Take off the heat, remove the garlic, then set the pan aside.
Cook the stalks in boiling salted water for about 4-5 mins until
tender, drain, then tip into the cream with the grated parmesan. Blitz
with a hand blender until smooth.
Cook the pasta according to pack instructions, then throw in the tips
2 mins before the end of cooking time. Gently reheat the cream, drain
pasta, then tip into a bowl with the cream. Toss, divide into pasta bowls,
top with parmesan shavings and serve.
