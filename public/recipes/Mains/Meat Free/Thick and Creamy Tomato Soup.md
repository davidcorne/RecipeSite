1. Add tomatoes, followed by chicken stock.
1. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until quite thick, about 1½ hours; adjust heat as needed to maintain a gentle simmer.
1. Taste broth; if its flavor is too sharp or acidic, add ¼ teaspoon baking soda and stir well (it will foam at first). Taste and repeat if needed.
1. Purée soup with an immersion blender until smooth, or cool until no longer steaming before puréeing in a countertop blender.
