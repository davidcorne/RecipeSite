# Aubergine Chilli Stir-Fry

This is a pretty heavily modified version of Fish Fragrant Aubergine that I learned on a Knife Skills cooking course at [Loaf](https://loaf.coop/). It’s best served with rice as aubergines soak up a lot of oil and sauce.

## Ingredients

- 4 + 1 tbsp neutral oil such as rapeseed
- 1 aubergine
- 1 bunch of spring onions
- 1 thumb of ginger
- 5 cloves of garlic
- 3 onions
- 2 bell peppers
- 1 red chilli

### Sauce

I didn’t note down how much of these ingredients I used, so these are approximate.

- ½ of a 368g jar of chilli and garlic sauce (I used Lee Kum Kee sauce)
- 2 tbsp tamari (substitute for light soy sauce if you don’t need it gluten free)
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 1 tbsp rice vinegar
- ½ tsp maple syrup

## Method

1. Prep the vegetables:
   1. 1 Aubergine: peeled, halved horizontally, cut into fingers (6-8 per half)
   2. Bunch of spring onions: remove tops and bottoms, chop as thinly as you can horizontally
   3. 5 cloves of garlic and thumb of ginger: smash, add salt and grid to a paste
   4. 3 onions and 2 peppers: cut into strips
   5. 1 red chilli: deseed and cut into strips
2. Heat a large pan/wok with the 4 tbsp of neutral oil to a medium-high heat.
3. In 2+ batches, fry off the aubergine fingers until they are browned and getting soft. About 80% cooked, as we’ll finish them in the sauce later)
4. Remove from the pan.
5. Heat the remaining 1 tbsp of oil.
6. Fry the the spring onions for a small amount of time (< 1 minute).
7. Add the garlic and ginger paste and fry until it’s very fragrant, 2-3 minutes.
8. Cook the onion and pepper strips for ~3 minutes.
9. Add the red chilli and cook for a further 2 minutes.
10. Add all of the sauce ingredients, and cook for a minute to combine. Adjust with the sauce ingredients to taste.
11. Add the fried aubergine and cook for another couple of minutes. Ensure you don’t stir too vigorously to not smash the aubergines.
12. Serve with rice.

## Notes

You can often add salt with the vegetables, but it’s not needed in this recipe due to the soy/tamari and chilli and garlic sauce.
