- 1 tsp butter
- 2 medium courgettes (about 350g), cut into 1-2cm dice
- pinch of chilli flakes
- pinch of grated nutmeg
- 2 spring onions, finely sliced
- ½ lemon, zested
- 150g risotto rice
- 75ml dry white wine or vermouth
- 750g warm vegetable or chicken stock
- 80g broad beans, blanched and peeled
- courgette flowers, stamen removed and petals torn (optional)
- 20g parmesan or vegetarian alternative, grated, plus extra to serve

### For the pesto

- 1 garlic clove
- 1 tbsp toasted pine nuts
- large handful of basil leaves , plus extra to serve
- handful of mint leaves
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp grated parmesan or vegetarian alternative

## Method ##

### Pesto 

1. To make the pesto, crush the garlic to a paste with a pinch of salt using a pestle and mortar.
1. Add the pine nuts and pound to a coarse paste, then tear in the basil and mint, pounding again until they’ve broken down.
1. Stir in the oil and cheese, then taste for seasoning – add more cheese if you like.

### Risotto

1. Heat the oil and butter in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat.
1. Add the courgettes, sprinkle in the chilli flakes and nutmeg, and season with salt and pepper.
1. Fry for 3-5 mins until the courgettes are golden and softened.
1. Add the spring onions and lemon zest, and stir for a minute or two.
1. Tip in the rice and stir to coat in the oil until translucent, about 2 mins.
1. Pour in the wine, then cook for a couple of minutes until it’s mostly evaporated.
1. Add a ladleful of the stock and stir for a few minutes until it’s absorbed.
1. Continue adding a ladleful at a time for 20-30 mins, stirring continually, until all of the stock is absorbed.
1. Stir in the blanched broad beans and flowers, if using, and warm through for 2 mins.
1. Remove from the heat and stir through the parmesan.
1. Allow to sit for about 5 mins, then swirl through half of the pesto.
1. Any remaining pesto will keep chilled for up to two days.
1. Divide the risotto between bowls and scatter with the extra basil leaves, extra cheese and another spoonful of the pesto, if you like.
