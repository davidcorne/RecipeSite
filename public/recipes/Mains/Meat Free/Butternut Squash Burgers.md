SERVES 4 PREP 20 mins COOK 20-30 mins EASY V

1 butternut squash (choose one

with a long neck, if you can)

1 red chilli, finely chopped

1 large garlic clove, finely grated 2 tbsp garlic-infused oil

small handful of parsley. finely chopped

handful of wild rocket

4 burger buns (ensure vegan, if needed)

4 tbsp mayonnaise (ensure vegan, if needed)

1 large tomato, sliced into 4, to serve

1 Cut the squash in half where the neck meets the bulbous part. Reserve the bulbous part for another recipe (see tip, right). Trim the stem at the top of the neck, then carefully slice into roughly lem discs - you should get about eight, depending on the length. Set aside. 2 Combine the chilli, garlic and oil with a pinch each of salt and ground pepper in a small bowl.

3 Light the barbecue and wait until the coals are ashen. Brush one side of the squash discs with the chilli and garlic mixture, then season with salt. Cook oiled-side down for 10 mins, closing the barbecue if you can and basting with more of the chilli and garlic mixture every few minutes until the discs begin to

soften. Flip over, brush with more of the chilli and garlic mixture, and cook for a further 10-15 mins, continuing to baste as before. Once tender and slightly caramelised. they are ready. Toss the parsley and rocket in the remaining chilli and garlic mixture.

4 Serve two squash burgers per bun, also filled with some of the dressed rocket and parsley leaves, a spoonful of mayo and slice of tomato.
