Best-ever macaroni cheese recipe
Method
Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6.
Spread the chunks of bread over a baking sheet, drizzle with the
melted butter and season. Bake for 6 mins until crisp, then set aside.
Boil the pasta for 2 mins less than stated on the pack. Meanwhile,
melt the remaining butter in a saucepan.
Add the garlic and mustard, cook for 1 min, then stir in the flour.
Cook for 1 min more, then gradually whisk in the milk until you have a
lump-free sauce. Simmer for 5 mins, whisking constantly until thickened.
Take off the heat, then stir in all the cheddar and half the
Parmesan.
Stir the pasta and some seasoning into the cheesy sauce, then tip
into a large ovenproof dish, or 4 individual dishes.

mins until crisp and golden. Can be frozen before baking â€“ defrost
