These Yorkshire puddings are designed to rise tall and light with a crisp shell and a lightly
chewy center. You want to take more control over how the puddings come out? Read up
on the science of Yorkshire puddings (https://www.seriouseats.com/2015/12/food-lab-yorkshire-
pudding-popover-best-method-science.html) to learn about the Ąner points of the process.

1.Combine eggs, ąour, milk, water, and salt in a medium bowl and
whisk until a smooth batter is formed. Let batter rest at room
temperature for at least 30 minutes. Alternatively, for best results,
transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate batter overnight or
for up to 3 days. Remove from refrigerator while you preheat the
oven.
2.Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 450°F
(230°C). Divide drippings (or other fat) evenly between two 8-inch
cast iron or oven-safe non-stick skillets, two 6-well popover tins
(see note), one 12-well standard muĆn tin, or one 24-well mini
muĆn tin. Preheat in the oven until the fat is smoking hot, about
10 minutes.
3.Transfer the pans or tins to a heat-proof surface (such as an
aluminum baking sheet on your stovetop), and divide the batter
evenly between every well (or between the two pans if using pans).
The wells should be Ąlled between 1/2 and 3/4 of the way (if using
pans, they should be Ąlled about 1/4 of the way). Immediately
return to oven. Bake until the yorkshire puddings have just about
quadrupled in volume, are deep brown all over, crisp to the touch,
and sound hollow when tapped. Smaller ones will take about 15
minutes, popover- or skillet-sized ones will take around 25
minutes.
Resting the batter overnight is key for developing better ąavor.•
Forget about cold batter: letting it rest at room temperature helps it rise taller as it bakes.•
A combination of milk and water gives the Yorkshire puddings extra rise and crispness.•
YIELD:Makes 2 skillet-sized, 8 popover-sized, 12 muĆn-sized, or 24 mini muĆn-sized puddings
ACTIVE TIME: 5 minutesTOTAL TIME:1 hour, or up to 3 days

4.Serve immediately, or cool completely, transfer to a zipper-lock

oven before serving.

The Yorkshire puddings come out best when the batter has been rested for at least one night, however they can be
cooked immediately after forming the batter if time requires it. Form the batter as directed in step 1 and
immediately proceed to step 2 without refrigerating it. The quantity of batter doesn't divide easily into standard 6-
well popover pans, but you can scale up the recipe by 50% in order to make a full 12 popovers instead of 8. If using
skim or low-fat milk, omit the water and increase amount of milk to 200g (7 ounces; 1 cup minus 2 tablespoons).
