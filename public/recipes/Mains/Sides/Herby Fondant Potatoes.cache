Herby fondant potatoes
Method
Trim the top and bottom of each potato so that they lie flat on both
sides. Heat the oil in a large frying pan or flameproof casserole and fry
the potatoes on both sides until dark golden, 10-15 mins.
Poke in the garlic, thyme, rosemary, bay leaves and zest, then pour
in enough stock to go halfway up the side of the potatoes. Simmer for
20-30 mins, then turn the potatoes and cook the other side for a further
20-30 mins, topping up with more stock if it evaporates. Continue
cooking until the potatoes are really tender and most of the stock has
gone. Season well and serve.
