# Carrot Pakora # 

This is from the January 2021 edition of BBC Good Food magazine. This is a nice naturally gluten free recipe. Makes 8 small or 4 large.

## Ingredients ## 

- 3 medium carrots, coarsely grated lengthways
- 2 shallots or 1 onion, finely sliced
- 25g coriander, roughly chopped
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- pinch of hot chilli powder (optional)
- 1 egg, beaten
- 100g cornflour
- sunflower oil, for deep-frying

### To Serve

- 100g natural yogurt
- 2 tbsp lime pickle (roughly chop if it's too chunky)
- Small handful of mint leaves, roughly chopped

## Method ## 

1. Tip the carrots and shallots or onion into a colander set over a sink, and toss with 1 tsp sea salt.
2. Leave to wilt for 10 minutes.
3. Meanwhile for the dip, combine the yogurt, pickle and mint. Chill until ready to use.
4. When the vegetables have wilted, wrap in a clean tea towel and squeeze out any excess water.
5. Tip into a bowl along with the coriander, spices and egg. Mix well.
6. Add the cornflour and stir until all the veg is evenly coated in thick batter - it's important that all the cornflour is mixed in properly.
7. Fill a deep, wide pan no more than two-thirds full of oil and heat to 180Â°C.
8. Working in batches carefully lower in two spoonfuls of the pakora mix at a time, well spaced apart.
9. Fry for 2 minutes on one side then 1-2 minutes more on the other side until golden and crisp.
10. Transfer to kitchen paper using a slotted spoon to drain.
11. Serve hot with the dip.
