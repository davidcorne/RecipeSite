1.Place the onion slices in a bowl, sprinkle with the pinch of salt, and mix
well with your hand to separate the slices. Stir in the garlic, turmeric,
curry powder, and coriander leaves.
 
2.Stir in the gram 紇ကour, and mix by hand. Add water, a little at a time until
a soft dough forms. The dough should not be too thick nor too liquid.
 
3.Heat the oil in a deep frying pan over high heat. Drop the dough by
tablespoons into the hot oil and fry until golden. Remove to a plate lined
with kitchen paper. Season with salt and pepper.

small chickpea, and is sometimes called besan 紇ကour.
