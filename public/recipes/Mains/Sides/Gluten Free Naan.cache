# Gluten Free Naan # 

This is a recipe originally from [here](https://glutenfreeonashoestring.com/naan-bread/).

## Ingredients ## 
- 350g all purpose gluten-free flour, plus more for sprinkling (I used Better Batter)
- 1 ¼ teaspoons xanthan gum (omit if your blend already contains it)
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt
- ¼ teaspoon cream of tartar
- 18g granulated sugar
- 2 ¼ teaspoons (8 g) instant yeast
- 75g plain yogurt, at room temperature
- 42g butter or ghee, melted and cooled
- 1 egg, plus 1 egg white at room temperature, beaten
- ¾ cup (175ml) warm water, about (95°F)
- Ghee or virgin coconut oil, for frying

## Method ## 
1. In the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, place the flour, xanthan gum, salt, cream of tartar, and sugar, and whisk to combine well.
2. Add the yeast and whisk again to combine.
3. Add the yogurt, butter or ghee, egg with egg white, and the water, and mix on low speed with the paddle attachment until just combined.
4. Once the water has been absorbed, turn the mixer up to medium speed and mix for about 3 minutes.
5. The dough will most likely be quite fluffy but will come together and thicken, then begin to pull away from the sides of the bowl in spots.
6. It will not turn into a fully integrated ball of dough on its own.
7. Turn off the mixer, scrape the dough off the sides of the bowl with a spatula, and gently press it into a ball.
8. Place the dough in a greased bucket  with a lid (or a bowl with a lid or one you can cover very tightly), and cover tightly.
9. If you plan to make naan the same day, place the dough in a warm, draft-free spot to rise until it is nearly doubled in volume, about 45 minutes. Alternatively, place the well-sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 2 to 3 days, and work with the dough straight from the refrigerator.
10. Once the dough has finished rising, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and sprinkle lightly with more flour.
11. Divide the dough into 8 pieces, each about 95 grams.
12. Working with one piece of dough at a time, lightly flour it and roll it into a round, then use a rolling pin to roll it into an elongated oval about ½ inch thick.
13. While you’re shaping the dough, place about 1 tablespoon of ghee or virgin coconut oil in a cast iron skillet, and melt over medium-low heat.
14. Place the first piece of shaped dough in the heated skillet and fry on one side until large blisters begin to form (about 30 seconds).
15. Flip and fry until the underside is golden brown.
16. Flip the bread again and cook until browned all over, about another minute.
17. Remove to a paper towel or tea towel, and cover the dough to retain the heat and moisture.
18. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough, adding more fat to the skillet as necessary. Stack the pieces of naan one on top of another, keeping them covered with a tea towel to maintain freshness.
19. Serve warm.
