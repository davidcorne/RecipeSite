Before We Begin
What’s the deal with pâte à choux? 
Well, so, the French pastry dough dates back to the sixteenth-century. In place of
a raising agent, the recipe uses moisture to create steam during cooking and puLJ
up the pastry. The best thing about mastering pâte à choux is that once you’ve got
the technique down, you can make a number of French delicacies such as
beignets and quenelles. Super cool, oui?
Jeez, how many types of gnocchi are there? 
So many! Potato, ricotta, semolina, cauliNjower—the list goes on. Then there are
close relatives like malfatti and gnudi. All of them are delicious.
What kind of sauce should I use? 
As with all of our favorite pastas, the topping options are endless! Our kitchen
sautéed these gnocchi with butter, lemon, and fresh parsley.
These little gnocchi look super tender—anything I should be worried about? 
We love NJnishing these perfect pillows with a light sear to create texture, but you
do have to be careful not to agitate them too much when searing. As they heat,
they get even more tender. To sear them right, start with a rippin’ hot pan and add
oil and brown butter. Then add a layer of gnocchi to coat the bottom. Let them
sizzle for 30–40 seconds, then check and see how the browning is coming along.
All right, I’m hooked. Any more handmade pasta recommendations?

2 Heat butter and milk
450 gMilk, whole
100 gButterIn a pot over medium heat, combine the butter and milk and heat until just boiling,making sure to fully melt the butter.
3 Add Njour
Add the sifted Njour to the milk mixture, and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon.
The mixture will start to ball up and pull cleanly away from the sides of the pot.
Reduce heat and cook for an additional four minutes to cook the starch in the Njour.
4 Mix it up
9 gSalt, kosher
1 gBlack pepper, ground 
0.5 gNutmeg, grated, optional 
300 gEggs
300 gParmesan, grated
Transfer the heated mixture to a stand mixer NJtted with the paddle attachment.
Add salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Set the mixer to medium speed, and slowly add in
the eggs, completely incorporating them into the dough.
Once eggs are mixed in, add the parmesan cheese and continue mixing until
homogenous.

5 Transfer to piping bag
Transfer the entire mixture to a piping bag NJtted with a large, round tip—we use a
#12 or #13 tip.
6 Cut and boil that gnocchi
-Oil, as neededIf you have someone to help, have that person cut the gnocchi as you pipe it out.
However, if you’re on your own, try this method:
Find a pot with two handles, and oil up a baking sheet.
Tie a piece of butcher’s twine taut between the pot handles—you will use the
string to cut the gnocchi.
Bring water to a boil in the pot. Working in batches, pipe gnocchi into the boiling
water a few at a time, using the butcher’s twine to cut pieces about 3 cm long.
Cook for two minutes, or until gnocchi start to Njoat to the top of the water. Then
remove and place on the oiled sheet tray. Transfer the tray to the refrigerator to
cool.
7 Finish and serve
-Butter, as neededTo NJnish, heat a skillet with a small amount of butter or olive oil, and let it get
rippin’ hot. Add a layer of gnocchi to the pan and let them cook for 30–40
seconds, completely untouched. When the time’s up, check to see how they are
browning—once you see the color you want, they are ready to go.
Complete this dish with any sauce you’d like—we prefer a simple NJnishing sauce:
just squeeze in some fresh lemon juice and dress those suckers up with French
herbs and some extra salt and pepper. Voilà: gnocchi à la parisienne!
More pasta, please.
