- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- 1 tsp coriander seeds
- 260g carrots
- 2 tbsp butter
- 2 tsp mild olive oil
- 1 cup milk
- 1 cup double cream
- salt, to taste

## Method ## 
1. Place cumin and coriander seeds in a small frypan and toast over low heat until fragrant. Remove from pan and reserve.
2. Peel carrots, reserving skins, and dice into small pieces.
3. Transfer to a saucepan, add ½ tablespoon of butter and olive oil and set over medium high heat.
4. Sauté until golden, about 2-3 minutes.
5. Reduce heat to low and add milk, cream, toasted spices and reserved carrot peel.
6. Cook until carrots are soft and the liquid has reduced and is light brown in colour.
7. Remove from heat. Strain, reserving liquid and solids.
8. Transfer cooked carrot pieces to the canister of a stick blender and process with remaining 1½ tablespoons butter and a little of the cooking liquid until a smooth puree forms.
9. Pass carrot puree through a sieve, season with salt and set aside, until serving.
