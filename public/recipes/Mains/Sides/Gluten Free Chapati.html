# Gluten Free Chapati # 

This is a nice gluten free recipe for a quick Indian style flatbread, from [Doves Farm](https://www.dovesfarm.co.uk/recipes/chapati-flat-breads)

This should make 6 chapati, but I have used half this recipe to make 4 smaller chapati and that works well.

## Ingredients ## 

- 250g Doves Farm Organic Strong White Bread Flour
- pinch of salt
- 2 tbsp oil
- 150ml tepid water
- oil, for frying

## Method ## 

1. Put the 250g flour and salt into a bowl, pour on the 150ml tepid water and add the 2 tbsp of oil.
1. Mix to make a smooth dough.
1. Cover and leave for 15 minutes or up to 4 hours.
1. Set a skillet, heavy frying pan or griddle to get **very** hot.
1. Cut the dough into 6 pieces.
1. Lightly dust the work surface and a rolling pin with flour.
1. Roll each dough ball into a 15cm/6‚Äù circle.
1. Ensure the pan is oiled.
1. Transfer a dough circle to the hot pan and cook for 1-2 minutes.
1. When the chapati starts to bubble up and the base has brown, toasted patches, turn it over and cook the other side for 1-2 minutes.
1. Lift the chapati out of the pan, wrap it in tin foil and keep warm until ready to serve.
1. Repeat with the remaining dough circles.
