# Sausagemeat Stuffing # 

This is the sausagemeat stuffing my family makes at Christmas time, I believe from Katie Stuart's cookbook. The original recipe is below.

## Ingredients ## 

- 115g smoked streaky bacon
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 15g butter
- 910g pork sausagemeat
- 1 level tsp rosemary, fresh if possible

## Method ## 

1. Trim and chop the bacon into small pieces.
2. Melt the butter in a saucepan then add the onion and bacon.
3. Fry gently until soft, but not browned.
4. Meanwhile mix the sausagemeat and herbs in a basin.
5. Add the bacon and onion into the basin, and mix well.
6. Cooking this will depend how you want the stuffing:
    - __Stuffing Balls:__ Form into balls, of about 1 tbsp of mix in each. Cook then all at ~180°C for 30-40 minutes.
    - __Loaf:__ Put into a loaf tin, bake at ~180°C for around 50 minutes.
    - __Bird/Joint:__ Stuff the bird or joint with the mixture, and add 1kg to the weight to work out the roasting time.
