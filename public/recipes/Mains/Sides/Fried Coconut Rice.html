# Fried Coconut Rice # 

This is a recipe from the 2020 October edition of BBC Good Food.

## Ingredients ## 

- 400g can coconut milk
- ½ tsp dried thyme
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 chicken stock cube
- 370g long-grained or basmati rice
- 1 tbsp groundnut or coconut oil
- ½ red onion, finely chopped
- 6 closed cup mushrooms, roughly chopped
- ½ each green and yellow peppers, finely chopped
- 1 large carrot, finely chopped
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- ¼ tsp ground turmeric
- 1 tsp garlic powder

## Method ## 

1. Bring the 400g can of coconut milk, ½ tsp dried thyme, 2 bay leaves, and chicken stock cube to the boil in a large pan.
2. Reduce the heat to medium-low.
3. Simmer for 5 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, rinse the 370g of rice until the water runs clear.
5. Drain in a colander, then add to the coconut milk mixture - it should be just about covered by the liquid.
6. Turn the heat up to medium-high, covering and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally so it doesn't catch.
7. When most of the liquid has been absorbed, the rice should be softened but still quite al dente.
8. Remove from the heat, and set aside.
9. Heat the 1 tbsp of oil in a large deep frying pan over a medium-high heat.
10. Add the; ½ red onion, 6 closed cup mushrooms, ½ green and ½ yellow peppers, carrot, 1 tsp ground coriander, ¼ tsp ground turmeric, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp ground ginger.
11. Fry for ~7 minutes, stirring to coat, until starting to soften.
12. Add the part-cooked rice and 50ml of water.
13. Season, reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and cook for 5-10 minutes, depending on how soft you like your rice.
14. Remove the bay leaf, serve up.
