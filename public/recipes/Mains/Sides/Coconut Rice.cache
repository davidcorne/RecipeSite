# Coconut Rice # 

I've tried a lot of different recipes for coconut rice, as it's something we always eat in Thai restaurants. However, I've never managed to make it satisfactorily. This is the closest I've gotten, and it's based on [this Nasi Lemak](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/nasi-lemak) recipe.

## Ingredients ## 

- 500g jasmine rice
- 175ml coconut milk
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp sugar (I used caster)
- 450ml water (350ml if using a rice cooker)
- 2 pandan leaves, or 2-3 drops of pandan essence
- 1 lemongrass stalk

## Method ## 

1. First, to prepare the rice, wash thoroughly in a sieve until the water runs clear.
1. Use a pan with a lid, put all the ingredients for the rice in and cover.
1. Simmer on a low heat for 10 mins, or until the liquid has evaporated.
1. Let the rice sit with the lid on for another 10 mins.
1. You should be able to see the individual rice grains. If the rice looks a bit wet, spread it out on a tray or into a colander to dry out before serving.

### Notes

- If using a rice cooker: put all the ingredients in and when the rice is ready, leave the lid on for 10 mins before opening, then fluff the rice with a fork.
- I've not managed to get hold of pandan leaves or essence, so I've left it out so far and it's tasted good.
