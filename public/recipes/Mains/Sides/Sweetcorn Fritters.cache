# Sweetcorn Fritters # 

This is a nice sweetcorn fritter recipe which is easily made child safe, originally from the [Hairy Bikers](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/sweetcorn_fritters_46558).

## Ingredients ## 

- 300g sweetcorn
- 3 spring onions, very finely chopped
- 3 free-range eggs
- 30ml milk
- 75g plain flour
- vegetable oil, for frying
- freshly ground black pepper

## Method ## 

1. To make the fritters, put the sweetcorn and spring onions in a bowl.
1. Beat the eggs with the milk.
1. Pour this mixture over the sweetcorn and mix well.
1. Season with pepper.
1. Sieve the flour with the cayenne pepper and then stir into the sweetcorn mixture.
1. Heat the oil in a large frying pan then test by adding a tiny bit of the batter – it should immediately start bubbling around the edges when it hits the oil.
1. Using a small ladle, drop batter onto the oil – you need around 2 tbsp of mixture per fritter. You should be able to fry 4–5 at any one time. Fry for a couple of minutes on one side until light brown then turn over and cook for a further minute.
1. Turn out onto kitchen paper to remove any excess oil and keep warm in a low oven. Continue until you have used all the batter.
