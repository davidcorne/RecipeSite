- 300g fine semolina or polenta
- 150g plain flour
- 1 tbsp baking powder
- 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda

1. Combine the semolina, flour, baking powder and bicarb in a large bowl and season.
1. Put the butter, eggs, pumpkin, buttermilk and chillies in a jug and whisk until combined.
1. Gradually stir the wet ingredients into the dry, being careful not to over-mix.
1. Pour into the pan and bake for 50 mins-1 hr until golden.
1. Meanwhile, prepare the whipped jalapeno butter:

    1. Season to taste.
