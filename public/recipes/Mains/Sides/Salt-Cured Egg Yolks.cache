INSTRUCTIONS
Cook's Note: We’ve tested this recipe using both gram measurements and traditional U.S. volume and
weight measurements, so you get to pick the one that works best for you.  
450 g kosher salt 
450 g sugar
Pulse salt and sugar in food processor until evenly mixed and slightly
ground, about 14 pulses. (Alternatively, salt and sugar can be processed in
blender on high speed until evenly mixed and slightly ground, about 30
seconds.) Transfer 400 grams salt mixture to 8-inch square baking pan and
shake pan to create even layer. Using whole, in-shell egg, make 12 evenly
spaced ¼-inch-deep indentations in salt bed by pressing bottom of egg
gently into salt mixture.  
1
660 g eggs (12 large eggs)
Working with 1 egg at a time, crack eggs, separate yolks from whites, and
transfer yolks to indentations in salt bed. Carefully pour remaining salt
mixture evenly over yolks. Wrap pan with plastic wrap and refrigerate until
yolks are 厠rm and dry throughout, 6 to 7 days. 
2
Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees F/93
degrees C. Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet. Fill medium bowl with cool
water. Remove yolks from salt mixture, brushing off excess, and rinse gently
in water. Pat yolks dry with paper towels and transfer to wire rack. Transfer
sheet to oven and bake until exteriors of yolks are dry to touch, 30 to 40
minutes.
3
Grate or thinly slice yolks and sprinkle on your favorite dishes, from pasta
and risotto to roasted vegetables and buttered toast. (Cured yolks can be
refrigerated in airtight container for up to 2 weeks.)
