Creamy Polenta
# Creamy Polenta # 

This is from a Guardian article [here](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/nov/21/how-to-make-perfect-polenta) originally. I've made it with less cooking and stock rather than milk.

## Ingredients ## 

- 750ml stock (vegetable or chicken)
- Â½ tsp salt
- 150g coarse cornmeal
- 50g butter
- 25g grated parmesan (optional)

## Method ## 

1. Put the stock in a large, heavy-based pan along with the salt, and bring to the boil.
2. Meanwhile, measure out the cornmeal and put it near the hob.
3. When the pan comes to the boil, add the cornmeal, letting it run in thin streams through your fingers, whisking continuously.
4. Stir for a minute or two until it thickens.
5. Turn the heat right down and stir well, roughly every 4-5 minutes to prevent it sticking, for about 35-45 minutes, until the polenta begins to come away from the sides of the pan.
6. Stir in the butter and cheese, if using, then put on a serving dish.
