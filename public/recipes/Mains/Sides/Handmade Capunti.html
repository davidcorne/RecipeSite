# Handmade Capunti # 

This comes from [this](https://www.chefsteps.com/activities/handmade-capunti-with-jason-stoneburner) chefsteps recipe.

## Explanations

#### Okay, what are durum and semolina, and why do I need both?
Durum flour and semolina are actually both made from milled durum wheat. Semolina is just one tiny part, the endosperm, separated from the rest of the grain during sifting and ground into a coarse yellow flour. Durum flour is durum wheat blitzed into a softer, finer flour. Why use both? By using both flours, you can dial in the texture of your pasta, meaning it’ll have a nice, toothsome bite, even when it’s freshly made.

#### Where do I get durum and semolina?
Most higher-end grocery stores like Whole Foods carry specialty flours, and you can also get them on Amazon, along with literally anything else you could ever want to buy. Stegosaurus dog costume, anyone?

#### Do I need to use saffron?
No, you do not. Saffron gives the pasta its rich, golden color, but if you can’t find it or don’t have it on hand, your pasta will be just fine without it.

#### What sauce should I use?
Any sauce you want! You can use capunti in any recipe that calls for short pasta—you might sub it for things like gemelli, rigatoni, or ziti. But hey, it’s your pasta. Top it however you want!

#### I thought pasta was made with egg. Why no egg in this recipe?
It’s true! Some pasta is made with egg. But some pasta is made without egg. Some pasta is made with saffron, some is made with ricotta, some is made with potatoes. Some types of pasta look like little zipper pouches, and others look like braided rings. When it comes to gluteny Italian treats, the pastabilities are endless.

## Ingredients ## 

- 170 g Durum flour
- 170 g Semolina
- 175 g Water
- Saffron, for color, as needed

## Method ## 

1. Mix durum and semolina together into a mound. Using the bottom of a bowl or cup, create a small well—this will help you slowly incorporate the wet with the dry ingredients.
2. Add threads of saffron to the water and stir until the water takes on a yellow color.
3. Strain the saffron water into the well and slowly incorporate the liquid, little by little. As the flour hydrates, the dough will take on the color of the saffron water.
4.Using your hands, knead the dough to fully hydrate it. Rotate the dough while kneading it to work different angles. Trust us: it’s very hard to overwork this stuff, so give it all you’ve got. You’re done kneading when the surface of the dough is smooth and springy.
5.Wrap the dough with plastic to seal in moisture, and let it rest for 20 minutes. When it’s ready, you’ll see the color shift to an intense yellow.
6. Cut off a 125 g portion of the pasta dough. Roll the portion into a rope, spreading your fingers as you roll, until it’s about a yard long. Don’t add flour while rolling; friction helps the dough stretch.
7. Slice the dough into sections about 5 cm long. Then round them out—they should look like doughy little bean pods.
8. Shape the Capunti:
    - For a more traditional, rustic approach to capunti, use your fingers to roll out the pasta. Roll the dough beneath the tips of two fingers, using slight pressure to create an indentation. The finished product should look like an open peapod.
    - To get real fancy with your capunti, use a textured surface—such as an ornate cutting board—to roll out your dough. Sprinkle semolina flour over your textured surface. Gently press down on the pasta with a knife and roll it out across the surface.
9. Boil capunti for two minutes and top with whatever sauce you like.
