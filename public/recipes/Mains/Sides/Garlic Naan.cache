Garlic Naan
# Garlic Naan # 

This is a fantastic recipe which comes from [this site](https://whattocooktoday.com/homemade-garlic-naan.html).

## Ingredients ## 

### Dry Ingredients
- 2 tsp instant yeast see notes if using active dry yeast
- 465g bread flour
- ½ Tbsp sugar
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp baking powder

### Wet Ingredients
- 250ml (1 cup) water
- 6 cloves garlic peeled and grated/finely chopped
- 83g (⅓ cup) plain Greek yogurt

### Naan Brushing
- ½ cup melted ghee or butter
- 2 cloves garlic grated/finely chopped
- Small bunch of coriander leaves

### Other

- Small amount of oil for proofing dough
- Butter/ghee to oil the pan

## Method ## 

### Dough

1. In a mixing bowl, combine the dry ingredients. 
2. Make a well in the center and add the wet ingredients.
3. Attach the dough hook and let it knead on low speed for about 5-8 minutes or so. 
4. Stop when the dough is no longer sticky to the bowl and comes together into a nice silky mass. It may be just a tiny bit sticky to the touch, but I know when this is the case, the bread will come out soft
5. Lightly oil the bowl and then cover and let it rises in a warm place until doubled in size (45minutes to 1 hour).

#### Notes: 

- If you are using active dry yeast, use lukewarm water and put the yeast in and let it sits until foamy (about 10 minutes) before mixing with the rest of the ingredients in step 2.
- If kneading by hand, gradually combine the wet and dry ingredients. Work through the sticky stage and knead until the dough is no longer sticky about 10-15 minutes. It will come together as smooth.

### Shaping and Cooking

1. Lightly dust your working surface and your hands with flour.
2. Place the dough on it and punch it down and knead it a few times and roll it into a long log and divide into 8 to 10 equal pieces of dough.
3. Keep them covered and work with one ball of dough at a time. Roll the dough out into about 6-inch irregular oval shape, slightly thicker at the edge.
4. Preheat your non-stick pan or cast-iron skillet (if you have one). 
5. Brush the skillet with some melted ghee/butter. 
6. Place the naan on the skillet and let it cook until the naan start to puff up and you see light brown spots about 1-2 minutes.
7. Brush with some ghee/butter and flip to the other sides and cook for another 1 minute or less.
8. Remove from the heat and brush with more melted ghee and garlic combo if you wish. 
9. Continue with the rest of the dough and stack them up as you cook them. 
10. Serve warm with some fresh coriander leaves or other dishes.
