<xmp theme="cerulean" style="display:none;">
# Yorkshire Pudding #

## Ingredients ##

- 75g self-raising flour
- 1 large egg
- 75 m semi-skimmed milk
- 55 ml water
- salt and freshly milled black pepper

## Method ##

This makes 4 yorkshire puddings.

### Making Batter ###

1. Sieve the flour into a large bowl, holding the sieve up high to give the 
   flour a good airing. 
2. Mix the wet ingredients together. I do this by measureing out 75ml of milk,
   topping it up to 110ml with water and cracking the egg into it. Mix this 
   thoroughly.
3. Make a well in the centre of the flour.
4. Add the liquid gradually while incorporating more flour into the mix.
5. When all the liquid has been added whisk until the batter is smooth. 
6. Season with salt and pepper.
7. To make adding the batter to the pan easier transfer the batter to a
measuring jug, or anything to help pour.

### Cooking Yorkshires ###

8. Preheat the oven to 200Â°C.
9. Add about half a tablespoon of oil to each hole in yorkshire pudding/muffin 
   tray. 
10. Place this in the oven for 5 minutes until the oil is very hot.
11. Quickly pour the batter into the oil and return to the oven.
12. Cook for 20 minutes.
