# Vegan Yorkshire Puddings # 

This is a good recipe from [Healthy Living James](https://healthylivingjames.co.uk/yorkshire-puddings-gluten-free-vegan/). For a vegan gluten free recipe these yorkshires work well and rise nicely.

## Ingredients ## 

- 75g gluten free self raising flour
- 75g Corn Flour
- 2 heaped tsp baking powder
- 200 ml unsweetened vegan milk (I used gluten free oat milk)
- 6 teaspoon sunflower oil

## Method ## 

1. In a deep cupcake tray add 1 teaspoon sunflower oil into each hole and place in a 210°C oven for at least 15 mins, you need the oil very hot!
1. Meanwhile, make the batter by adding both flours, baking powder and milk to a large mixing bowl and whisking until smooth.
1. Allow to rest for 5 minutes before transferring to something that pours well
1. Remove the tray from the oven and evenly pour into each making sure to not overfill, place back in the oven for 15 mins (Try not to open the oven whilst they’re cooking)
