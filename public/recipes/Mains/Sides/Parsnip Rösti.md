# Parsnip Rösti # 

This was from a river cottage recipe [here](https://www.rivercottage.net/recipes/parsnip-rosti). I've made it with half an onion grated into it, and that worked very well. Also I'd recommend squeezing some moisture out of the vegetable mix.

## Ingredients ## 
- 400g parsnips (about 2 large ones)
- ½ white onion
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 2 tbsp cornflour or arrowroot
- Duck fat, lard or, vegetable or coconut oil, for frying
- Sea salt
- Butter or crème fraîche, to serve (optional)

## Method ## 

1. Peel and coarsely grate the parsnips and onion into a large bowl.
2. Squeeze the moisture out of the vegetable mixture.
3. Add the egg, cornflour or arrowroot and a couple of good pinches of salt.
4. Mix well to combine.
5. Heat a heavy-based frying pan over a medium heat and grease four crumpet rings, or other metal rings.
6. Add 2 tsp fat to the pan and let it melt.
7. Pop the metal rings into the pan and fill with the parsnip mixture, packing it down a little: it should be no more than 2cm thick, or they won’t cook through. If you don’t have any rings, simply make little piles of the mixture in the pan and squash them down a bit.
8. Allow the rösti to cook for a few minutes and then check the underside by lifting it up with a palette knife. If the underneath is deep golden brown, lift off the rings using tongs or a tea towel and turn the rösti over to cook the other side. If you struggle to get the rings off, just run a butter knife around the inside of each one.
9. Serve the rösti straight away, topped with a knob of butter or a dollop of crème fraîche, or just as they are as a side dish.
