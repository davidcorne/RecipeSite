# Crispy Chicken Skin # 

This is from a recipe [here](https://www.greatbritishchefs.com/how-to-cook/how-to-make-crispy-chicken-skin).

## Ingredients ## 

- 2-4 chicken skins from a thigh.

## Method ## 

1. Preheat the oven to 180°C.
2. Using a small, sharp knife, lay the skins skin-side down and scrape off any excess fat and remaining meat. You should be left with just the thin skin.
3. Lay the skins stretched out flat on a greaseproof-lined baking sheet.
4. Sprinkle with a pinch of flaky sea salt.
5. Lay a second sheet of greaseproof paper over the skins then weigh down with another tray.
6. Place in the oven for 10–15 minutes, after which time they should be golden brown and crisp. Be careful not to let them colour too much or they will taste bitter.
7. Save the chicken fat gathered on the tray to whisk into butter. 
8. Place the skins on kitchen paper and sprinkle with salt.
9. Store in airtight container in a cool, dark place for up to 5 days (they can be kept out of the fridge).
