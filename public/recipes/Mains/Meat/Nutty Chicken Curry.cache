Nutty chicken curry
Method
Finely slice a quarter of the chilli, then put the rest in a food
processor with the ginger, garlic, coriander stalks and one-third of
the leaves. Whizz to a rough paste with a splash of water if needed.
Heat the oil in a frying pan, then quickly brown the chicken
chunks for 1 min. Stir in the paste for another min, then add the
peanut butter, stock and yogurt. When the sauce is gently bubbling,
cook for 10 mins until the chicken is just cooked through and sauce
thickened. Stir in most of the remaining coriander, then scatter the
rest on top with the chilli, if using. Eat with rice or mashed sweet
potato.
