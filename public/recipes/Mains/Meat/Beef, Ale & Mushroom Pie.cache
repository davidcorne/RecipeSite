Beef, Ale & Mushroom Pie

Proper beef, ale & mushroom pie
Method
Start by braising the beef. If you’re using the porcini, cover them
in boiling water for 20 mins, then squeeze out but keep the soaking
water. Heat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Heat half the oil in a
large casserole dish, brown the meat really well in batches, then set
aside. Add the onions and carrots to the pan, adding a drizzle more
oil, then cook on a low heat for 5 mins until coloured. Add the
soaked mushrooms, sizzle for 1 min more, then scatter over the
sugar and flour, stirring until the flour turns brown. Tip the meat and
any juices back into the pan and give it all a good stir. Pour over the
ale, stock and porcini soaking liquid, discarding the last few drops.
Season stew, tuck in the herbs and bring everything to a simmer.
Cover with a lid and place in the oven for about 2 hrs, until the meat
is really tender.
While the stew is cooking, heat a drop more oil in a frying pan
and sizzle the bacon for 3 mins until crisp. Turn up the heat, add the
mushrooms and cook for 4 mins until golden. Remove from the heat
Ingredients
For the beef
small handful dried porcini
mushrooms (about 10g) - not
essential but very tasty

whole piece and cut it yourself into
large chunks)
2 large onion, roughly chopped
4 large carrots, chopped into large
chunks
2 tsp golden caster sugar
4 tbsp plain flour
300ml dark ale

mushrooms and cook for 4 mins until golden. Remove from the heat
and, when the stew is cooked, stir them through. Leave everything
to cool completely – better still, make this up to 2 days in advance
and keep it in the fridge as the pie will be better if the filling is fridge-
cold when added. Can also be frozen for up to 3 months and
defrosted when needed.
Make the pastry up to 2 days before you want to assemble the
pie. Crumble the flour and lard, or butter, together with a generous
pinch of sea salt until completely combined, then add up to 200ml
ice-cold water to make a soft dough. This can be done in a food
processor if you want. Knead the pastry, then wrap in cling film and
leave to rest in the fridge for at least 1 hr. The pastry can be made
up to 2 days ahead and kept in the fridge or frozen for up to a
month.
When you want to make the pie, heat oven to 220C/200C
fan/gas 7 and place a flat baking tray in the oven. Heavily grease a
24-28cm pie dish and dust well with flour. Cut a third off the pastry
and set aside. Roll out the pastry to a thick-ish round that will easily
line the pie dish with an overhang, then line the tin. Add the beef to
the dish using a slotted spoon so some gravy is left in the container,
as you don’t want too much sauce in the pie. You want the filling to
be slightly higher than the rim of the dish. If you have a bit too much,
set it aside.
Roll out the remaining pastry to a thick round big enough to
cover the dish. Brush the edges of the pastry in the dish with egg
yolk, then cover with the pastry lid. Trim the edges, crimp the pastry,
then re-roll your trimmings to make a decoration, if you like – I
always decorate my pies with pastry leaves. Brush the top heavily
with egg. Make a few little slits in the centre of the pie, place on the
hot baking tray, then bake for 40 mins until golden. Leave the pie to
rest for 10 mins while you heat up the gravy left in the container.
Serve the pie at the table with a jug of gravy and a big pile of
something green and leafy.
200g chestnut mushroom, halved
For the pastry
650g plain flour, plus extra for
dusting
250g lard or cold butter (or half of
each), diced, plus extra for
greasing
1 egg yolk, beaten, to glaze
