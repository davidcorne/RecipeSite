# Piri Piri Chicken Smashed Sweet Potatoes Broccoli #

This is a [BBC Good Food](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/piri-piri-chicken-smashed-sweet-potatoes-broccoli) recipe, and a spice mix from [here](https://www.sprinklesandsprouts.com/peri-peri-seasoning/) which I removed the sugar and salt from.

## Ingredients ##

- 3 large sweet potatoes (about 900g), peeled and cut into large chunks
- oil, for drizzling
- 6-8 chicken thighs, skin left on
- 2 red onions, cut into wedges
- 25g sachet piri-piri spice mix (or see later for a baby safe piri-piri spice mix)
- 300g long-stem broccoli

## Method ##

1. Heat the oven to 180°C/160°C fan.
1. Toss the sweet potatoes with a generous drizzle of oil and some seasoning, and tip into a very large roasting tin. Push the potatoes to one end of the tin, then, in the other end, toss the chicken with the onions, spice mix, a drizzle of oil and some seasoning.
1. Roast for 40 mins, stirring everything halfway through.
1. Add the broccoli to the tin, drizzle with a little oil and season, then roast for 10-15 mins more.
1. Serve from the tin in the middle of the table.
