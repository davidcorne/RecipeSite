Bhaji burger
Method
First, make the burgers. Tip all the ingredients into a bowl with a
good pinch of salt and squeeze together with your fingers. Shape
into three patties and chill in the fridge.
For the raita, grate the cucumber and squeeze out as much
liquid as you can. Put in a bowl with the yogurt, mint and some salt.
Mix and chill.
For the bhajis, tip the flour, spices and bicarb into a bowl with a
pinch of salt. Slowly add 200ml cold water to make a thick batter
(you might not need all of it), then mix in the onion.
Heat the oil in a large frying pan. Add the batter in batches so
you have three burger-sized bhajis. Sizzle for 3 mins until crispy on
one side, then flip and cook on the other side until cooked through.
Keep warm.
