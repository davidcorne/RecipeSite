Jerk chicken with rice & peas
Method
To make the jerk marinade, combine all the ingredients in a
food processor along with 1 tsp salt, and blend to a purée. If you’re
having trouble getting it to blend, just keep turning off the blender,
stirring the mixture, and trying again. Eventually it will start to blend
up – don’t be tempted to add water, as you want a thick paste.
Taste the jerk mixture for seasoning – it should taste pretty salty,
but not unpleasantly, puckering salty. You can now throw in more
chillies if it’s not spicy enough for you. If it tastes too salty and sour,
try adding in a bit more brown sugar until the mixture tastes well
balanced.
Make a few slashes in the chicken thighs and pour the
marinade over the meat, rubbing it into all the crevices. Cover and
leave to marinate overnight in the fridge.
If you want to barbecue your chicken, get the coals burning 1 hr

or so before you’re ready to cook. Authentic jerked meats are not
exactly grilled as we think of grilling, but sort of smoke-grilled. To
get a more authentic jerk experience, add some wood chips to your
barbecue, and cook your chicken over slow, indirect heat for 30
mins. To cook in the oven, heat to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Put the
chicken pieces in a roasting tin with the lime halves and cook for 45
mins until tender and cooked through.
While the chicken is cooking, prepare the rice & peas. Rinse the
rice in plenty of cold water, then tip it into a large saucepan with all
the remaining ingredients except the kidney beans. Season with
salt, add 300ml cold water and set over a high heat. Once the rice
begins to boil, turn it down to a medium heat, cover and cook for 10
mins.
Add the beans to the rice, then cover with a lid. Leave off the
heat for 5 mins until all the liquid is absorbed. Squeeze the roasted
lime over the chicken and serve with the rice & peas, and some hot
sauce if you like it really spicy.
For the rice & peas
200g basmati rice
400g can coconut milk
1 bunch spring onions, sliced
2 large thyme sprigs
2 garlic clove, finely chopped
1 tsp ground allspice
2 x 410g cans kidney beans,
drained
