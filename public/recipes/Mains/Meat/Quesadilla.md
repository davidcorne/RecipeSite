# Quesadilla # 

This is a Quesadilla recipe from [The Spicery](https://www.thespicery.com/). I've edited it to be child friendly. The changes are; use turkey mince instead of sausagemeat, and reduce the salt. I've also reorganised and reworded the recipe to suit my reading/cooking style.

These steps are presented sequentially, but can be done in parallel.

### Spice Blend

1. Mix together all of the spices

### Quesadilla Mix

1. Blend the garlic with the chillies (if using), 3 tbsp tomato puree, 3 tbsp vinegar, 100ml water and 3½ tsp of the spice blend to a smooth paste (adding an extra splash of water if necessary)
1. Fry the turkey mince in 2 tbsp oil for 4 minutes or until cooked through and beginning to brown.
1. Add the chopped onion and the blended paste to the browned meat then cook on a high heat for 5 minutes or until all the liquid has evaporated.

### Refried Beans

1. Blend one of the tins of black beans (including all the liquid from the tin) to a smoothish puree
1. Heat the puree with the remaining drained tin of black beans, the remaining spice and 2 tsp salt, mashing the beans up a bit as they cook and stirring frequently. Cook for 10 minutes, or until hot through and a spoon stirred through the centre leaves a trail.

### Pico de Gallo/Salsa

1. Mix the onion with the juice of ½ the lime and ¼ tsp salt. Leave to marinate for 10 minutes
1. Stir the tomatoes and coriander into the marinated onion to make a salsa. 

### Quesadilla

1. Preheat the oven to 150°C/gas mark 2
1. Spoon ¼ of the quesadilla meat mixture onto one half of a tortilla, sprinkle over ¼ of the cheese then fold the other half over to make a semicircle (pressing down to make it stick).
1. Repeat with the remaining tortillas, meat and cheese
1. Heat a large frying pan until hot.
1. Dry fry the quesadilla for 2 minutes or until golden brown and crisp, carefully flip the quesadilla over then cook for a further 2 minutes or until golden brown and crisp on the other side.
1. Slide onto a baking tray then keep warm in the oven while you repeat with the 3 remaining quesadillas

### Serving

1. Cut the quesadillas into wedges then serve with the beans, avocado, salad, sour cream and salsa, with the remaining ½ lime cut into wedges to squeeze over at the table
