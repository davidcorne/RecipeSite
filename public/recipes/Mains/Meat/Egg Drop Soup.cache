Egg Drop Soup
# Egg Drop Soup # 
  
This is a recipe from [here](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/egg-drop-soup/). It's a staple at Chinese restaurants across the United States.

We've changed it slightly, as there was a little too much spring onion and added a note about getting the soup too hot. I've also tried it with a few chilli flakes, and that gave a nice gentle heat to it.
  
## Ingredients ## 
  
- 850ml good-quality chicken or vegetable stock
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- 3 eggs
- ½ teaspoon toasted sesame oil
- 3 spring onions, thinly sliced, plus extra for garnish
- (optional) 25g corn
- fine sea salt and freshly-cracked black pepper, to taste

## Method ## 

1. Whisk together stock (chilled or room-temperature), cornstarch, ginger and garlic powder in a medium sauce pan until smooth.
2. Heat over high heat until the stock comes to a simmer, stirring occasionally.
3. Meanwhile, whisk together the eggs in a small measuring cup or bowl.
4. Once the broth reaches a simmer, use a fork or a whisk to stir the broth in a circular motion, creating a whirlpool. Note, don't let it boil you don't want it to be so hot that the egg immediately emulsifies.
5. Slowly pour the whisked eggs into the soup as you continue stirring, in order to create long egg ribbons.
6. Remove pan from heat.  
7. Stir in the sesame oil, green onions and corn (optional) until combined.
8. Season with salt and pepper to taste, also adding a dash or two of more sesame oil if needed.
6. Serve immediately, sprinkled with additional green onions.
