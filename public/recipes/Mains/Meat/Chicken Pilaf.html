# Chicken Pilaf # 

This is a chicken pilaf recipe from [here](http://www.nutrizonia.com/saffron-rice-pilaf-with-chicken/). I've changed the quantities, and made some notes about how I might do this next time.

## Ingredients ## 

- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 100g pistachios
- 75g dried cranberry
- Orange zest of 2 oranges
- 8 tbsp of raisins
- 2 cups of basmati rice
- 3 cups chicken stock
- 2 onions minced
- Few threads of saffron divided
- 2 tbsp of rose water
- 1 broken down chicken, i.e. 2 breasts, 2 legs, 2 thighs

### Spice Mix
- ½ tsp ground black pepper
- ½ tsp cinnamon
- ½ tsp cloves
- ½ tsp cardamom
- ½ tsp coriander
- ½ tsp cumin
- ½ tsp paprika

### Dressing
- 1 tbsp of ghee or butter
- Almonds, pine nuts and cashews

## Notes
- The 10 minutes was too long for the toasting cranberries and pistachios.
- It's a bit unclear if you should be stirring the pilaf or not during the 30 minutes.

## Method ## 

1. Wash the rice thoroughly, and soak it at least 30 minutes.
1. In a large pot, add oil. Saute onion, cranberries, raisins, orange zest, pistachios for 10 minutes on low heat.
1. Add chicken, spice mix, saffron threads and salt, saute for 5 minutes.
1. Add rice, and saute again for about 3 minutes.
1. Add the chicken broth and cover the pot with a tight lid.
1. Keep it on high heat for 5 minutes.
1. Turn the heat to lowest, and keep the pilaf for 30 minutes, or until the rice fluffy and absorbed the liquid completely.
1. Before the rice is completely done, after around 25 minutes, mix saffron threads with rose water and add them to the rice, and cover the pot again.

### Dressing
1. In a small skillet, add 1 tbsp of ghee/butter, when its hot, add almonds, pine nuts, cashews, toast them until they are golden brown, and drizzle over the rice.
1. Serve the rice with yogurt or some salad.
