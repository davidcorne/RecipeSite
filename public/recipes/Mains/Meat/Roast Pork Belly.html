# Roast Pork Belly, Fondant Potatoes & Pickled Onions # 

This is from the 2020 February issue of Good Food Magazine.

## Ingredients ## 
- ½ tsp dried thyme
- ½ tsp mace
- 1 star anise, ground to a powder using a pestle and mortar
- 1 tbsp sea salt flakes
- 2.5kg bone-in pork belly, skin scored
- 50g butter, softened, for the tin
- 12 medium Maris Piper potatoes
- 1 bunch of thyme
- 454g jar pickled onions, drained
- 125ml chicken stock

## Method ## 
1. Mix the thyme, mace, star anise and sea salt flakes together in a small bowl.
1. Rub all over the pork belly. If you have time, transfer the pork to a tray and marinate in the fridge for up to 24 hrs, but this is not essential.
2. Heat the oven to 220°C/200°C fan and butter a large roasting tin.
2. Cut a thin slice lengthways from both sides of each potato, then sit them flat in the prepared tin in one even layer.
2. Scatter over the thyme and onions, then pour over the chicken stock.
3. Sit the pork on top of the potatoes, skin-side up and roast for 30 mins.
3. Reduce the oven to 180°C/160°C fan for 1 hr 30 mins, until the skin is crisp.
4. Transfer the pork to a board, then cover loosely with foil and leave to rest for 20 mins.
4. Return the tin with the potatoes to the oven and increase the oven temperature to 200°C/180°C fan for 25-30 mins until crisp.
5. Carve the pork into generous squares (you can use a bread knife to do this more easily) and serve alongside the fondant potatoes and caramelised pickled onions.
