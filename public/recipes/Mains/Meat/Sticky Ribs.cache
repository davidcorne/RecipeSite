Sticky ribs with roast potato salad
Method
Heat oven to 150C/130C fan/gas 2. Put the ribs in a roasting tin in a
single layer and just cover with water. Cover with foil and cook for 1½
hrs. Drain well. If you are not finishing these straight away, cover and
chill until ready to cook.
Meanwhile, fry the onion in the oil in a pan until soft. Add the garlic,
smoked paprika and chilli powder and fry for 1 min. Add the passata,
puree, vinegar and sugar and bring everything to a simmer. Cook for 10
mins. If you are not using this sauce straight away, cool and chill.
Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Brush the ribs all over with the
sauce and lay on a baking sheet. Mix the potatoes with the oil,
rosemary and seasoning in a large roasting tin. Roast for 40 mins on a
middle shelf, with the ribs on the shelf above. Turn the ribs and
potatoes halfway, until both are nicely browned all over. Tip the
potatoes into a large bowl sprinkle with the vinegar and serve hot, warm
or cold. Slice the ribs to serve and put any extra sauce into bowls for
dipping.
