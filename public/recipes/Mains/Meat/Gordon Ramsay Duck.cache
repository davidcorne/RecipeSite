Gordon Ramsay Duck
# Gordon Ramsay's Pan-Seared Duck with Pak Choi & Orange Sauce # 

This is from the 2020 February issue of Good Food Magazine.

## Ingredients ## 
- 2 duck breasts, skin on
- 2 pak choi, halved
- 125ml orange juice
- 50ml soy sauce
- 1cm piece of ginger, peeled and grated
- 25g butter, cubed
- 25g runny honey
- ½ tbsp black and white sesame seeds cooked rice, to serve


## Method ## 
1. Heat the oven to 220°C/200°C fan with a baking tray inside.
1. Meanwhile, use a sharp knife to score the duck skin diagonally in one direction, then in the other to create a diamond pattern.
1. Season the duck breast.
2. Put the duck, skin-side down, in a non-stick frying pan.
3. Cook over a medium-high heat for 7 mins, or until the fat melts and the skin has turned crisp and golden.
3. Transfer the duck to the baking tray in the oven, turning it over to cook on the other side, for 3-4 mins, then set aside on a warm plate.
4. Return the pan to the hob and cook the pak choi in the duck fat for 4 mins, or until beginning to colour.
4. Remove the pak choi and set aside on a plate, then tip in the orange juice, soy sauce, ginger and butter, and bring to a simmer.
5. Stir in the honey and reduce to a thick sauce over a high heat for 5-8 mins.

### To Serve
1. Slice the duck at an angle and plate up alongside the pak choi.
2. Pour over the sauce and sprinkle with the sesame seeds before serving with some cooked rice.
