## Ingredients ## 

### Fish
- 2x175g thick cod or haddock fillets, taken from the head end rather than the tail end of the fish
- 80g self-raising flour, plus extra for dusting
- salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 100ml fridge-cold lager

### Chips
- 6-8 large floury potatoes, such as maris piper, king edward, desiree (depending on how hungry you are)

## Method ## 

1. Preheat the oven to 150°C and preheat the oil to 120°C.
2. Cut the potatoes into whatever size you prefer.
3. Wash well in cold water, you can do this 1-2 hours before and keep them in cold salted water. 
4. Drain and pat dry with a clean tea towel.
4. In batches put the potatoes into the fryer and allow them to fry gently for about 8-10 minutes, until they are soft but still pale.
5. Lift out of the pan and leave to cool slightly on greaseproof paper.
6. Increase the heat of the fryer to 180°C.
7. Season the fish and dust lightly with flour; this enables the batter to stick to the fish.
8. To make the batter, sift the flour and a pinch of salt into a large bowl and whisk in the lager to give a thick batter, adding a little extra beer if it seems over-thick. It should be the consistency of very thick double cream and should coat the back of a wooden spoon.
9. Season with salt and thickly coat 2 of the fillets with the batter.
9. Carefully place in the hot fat and cook for 8-10 minutes until golden and crispy. Remove from the pan, drain and sit on a baking sheet lined with greaseproof paper, then keep warm in the oven while you cook the remaining 2 fillets in the same way.
10. Once the fish is cooked, return the chips to the fryer and cook for 2-3 minutes or until golden and crispy.
11. Shake off any excess fat and season with salt before serving with the crispy fish.
