# Lemon Chicken # 

This is a good takeaway style lemon chicken recipe from [Tasty](https://tasty.co/recipe/chinese-take-away-style-lemon-chicken). I've not included the instructions on breading and cooking chicken, and I've doubled the recipe.

## Ingredients ## 

120ml chicken stock
1 lemon zested
2 lemons, juiced
8 tablespoons sugar
2 tablespoons water
1 tablespoon corn flour

## Method ## 

1. In a small pan, combine the chicken stock, lemon juice, and sugar.
1. Bring the mixture to a boil.
1. Mix the corn flour with the water, then add the mixture to the frying pan to thicken the sauce.
