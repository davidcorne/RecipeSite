# Chicken Tikka # 

This is a recipe from [The Curry Guy](https://greatcurryrecipes.net/2013/05/16/making-chicken-tikka/), and it works really well for chicken in a curry, or on it's own.

## Ingredients ## 

- 1 kilo (2 lbs.) chicken breasts - cut into bite sized pieces (tikka)
- Juice of two lemons
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 250ml (1 cup) plain yogurt
- 2 tablespoons garlic puree
- 1 tablespoon ginger puree
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 1 tablespoon ground coriander
- 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon citric acid powder
- 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
- 1 teaspoon salt (more or less to taste)
- 2 green chillies finely chopped
- 1 bunch of coriander leaves finely chopped

## Method ## 

1. Place the chicken tikka in a large bowl and squeeze the lemon juice over them and sprinkle with a little salt.
2. Now, whisk the second marinade ingredients together and pour it over the chicken.
3. Cover the chicken pieces with the marinade ensuring the chicken tikka are completely coated with the marinade.
4. Allow to marinaded for six hours or up to 48 hours - the longer the better. If you don't have time to marinate the chicken, 30 minutes or so will still be good.
5. When ready to cook, light a barbecue. Gas barbecues will work but I prefer the flavour of charcoal barbecues.
6. You are ready to grill when you can hold your hand two inches above the grill without it being unbearably hot.
7. Cook the chicken tikka on skewers turning occasionally until the chicken is cooked through and the edges are blackened. In the oven at 200Â°C this took ~40 minutes.
8. Serve, or set aside to use in a curry.
