# Cantonese Char Siu #

This is a [BBC Good Food](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/cantonese-char-siu) recipe.

## Ingredients ##

- 3 pork shoulder steaks (choose fattier steaks, if possible)
- Cooked jasmine rice and steamed pak choi, to serve
- 1 spring onion, finely sliced, to serve

### For the marinade

- 2 tbsp hoisin sauce (you can also use oyster sauce, but you’ll need more honey as it’s less sweet)
- ½ cube red bean curd from a can, plus 3 tsp sauce from the can (can be substituted with miso paste)
- ½ tsp light soy sauce
- ½ tsp dark soy sauce
- 1 tsp Shaohsing rice wine (Chinese cooking wine)
- 2 garlic cloves, finely grated
- 6 tbsp honey

## Method ##

1. Whisk the hoisin sauce, red bean curd (along with the sauce from the can), the soy sauces, rice wine, garlic and 3 tbsp honey together.
1. Tip half into a large bowl with the pork, reserving the rest of the marinade for basting later.
1. Season the pork, toss to coat and chill for 5 hrs to marinate.
1. Heat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan.
1. Transfer the pork to a roasting tin and roast for 30 mins.
1. Meanwhile, mix the remaining marinade with the rest of the honey.
1. Brush over the pork every 10 mins, so it’s evenly coloured.
1. Serve with the rice and pak choi, and the spring onions scattered over.
