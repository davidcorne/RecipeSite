# Roast Leg of Lamb Provençal # 

This is originally a recipe from an old cook book my mother uses by Robert Carrier. There is a photo at the bottom.

## Ingredients ## 
- Leg of lamb (2.5-3kg), trimmed and tied.
- 1 tbsp butter
- 6 cloves garlic
- 700g potatoes
- 230ml chicken stock
- 4-6 tbsp parsley
- 4-6 tbsp rosemary
- Salt and pepper

## Method ## 

1. Preheat oven to 160°C.
2. Butter a shallow dish just large enough to hold the leg of lamb.
2. Rub the dish with a cut clove of garlic.
3. Peel and cut potatoes in thick slices.
4. Arrange the potatoes in the bottom of the dish in overlapping rows, seasoning generously.
5. Chop remaining garlic finely and sprinkle over potatoes with the rosemary and parsley.
6. Roast in the oven for 1¼-1½ hours or until lamb is pink and tender.
