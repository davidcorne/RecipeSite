# Thai Peanut Beef # 

## Ingredients ## 

- 450g Flank or Skirt Steak thinly sliced across the grain
- 2-3 teaspoons oil

### Sauce
- ½ cup creamy peanut butter
- 2 teaspoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons Sriracha hot sauce
- ¼ cup chopped peanuts, optional
- 3-4 tablespoons water, to thin if needed

### Garnish

- Sliced spring onion
- Coriander

## Method ## 

1. Whisk together all sauce ingredients excluding peanuts.
2. Add water 1 tablespoon at a time until sauce is a smooth, pourable consistency.
3. Add oil to large pan or skillet and heat over medium high heat until hot. 
4. Add beef strips and cook for 8-10 minutes, stirring throughout to ensure even cooking.
5. When beef has browned around edges and cooked to desired doneness, add half of the sauce to the pan. 
6. Stir and cook 1-2 minutes longer.
7. Top with remaining sauce and chopped peanuts.
8. Garnish if desired and serve.

## Notes
Alternative cooking option: if you prefer your steak cooked medium or rare, sear steak whole (not sliced) for 5-8 minutes on each side until browned and cooked to desired doneness.  (62°C for medium rare, 70°C for medium) Thinly slice, return to pan with the sauce and saute 1-2 minutes.
