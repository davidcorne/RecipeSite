- 1 tablespoon (15ml) ají amarillo pepper paste (see note)
- 1 cup fresh cilantro leaves (1 ounce; 28g)
- 2 medium cloves garlic
- 120ml mayonnaise
- 60ml sour cream
- 2 teaspoons (10ml) fresh juice from 1 lime
- 1 teaspoon (5ml) distilled white vinegar
- 2 tablespoons (30ml) extra virgin olive oil
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

### Chicken

- 1 whole chicken, 1.6 to 1.8kg
- 4 teaspoons (20g) kosher salt
- 2 tablespoons (30g) ground cumin
- 2 tablespoons (30g) paprika
- 1 teaspoon (5g) freshly ground black pepper
- 3 medium cloves garlic, minced (about 1 tablespoon)
- 2 tablespoons (30ml) white vinegar
- 2 tablespoons (30ml) vegetable or canola oil

## Method ## 

### For the Sauce

1. Combine jalapeños, ají amarillo (if using), cilantro, garlic, mayonnaise, sour cream, lime juice, and vinegar in the jar of a blender.
1. Blend on high speed, scraping down as necessary, until smooth.
1. With blender running, slowly drizzle in olive oil.
1. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
1. Sauce will be quite loose at this point, but will thicken as it sits. Transfer to a sealed container and refrigerate until ready to use.

### Preparing the Chicken

1. Pat chicken dry with paper towels and place on a large cutting board, breast side down.
1. Using sharp kitchen shears, remove backbone by cutting along either side of it.
1. Turn chicken over and lay out flat.
1. Press firmly on breast to flatten chicken.
1. For added stability, run a metal or wooden skewer horizontally through chicken, entering through one thigh, going through both breast halves, and exiting through other thigh.
1. Tuck wing tips behind back.
1. Set a wire rack on a rimmed baking sheet lined with foil.
1. Position the chicken so that the breasts are in the centre of the sheet and the legs are close to the edge.

### Spicing the Chicken

1. Combine salt, cumin, paprika, pepper, garlic, vinegar, and oil in a small bowl and massage with fingertips until homogeneous.
1. Spread mixture evenly over all surfaces of chicken.
1. You can do this the night before if you need to.

### Cooking the Chicken

1. Preheat the oven to 230°C
1. Roast the chicken until the thickest part of the breast close to the bone registers 62°C and the joint between thighs and body registers at least 71°C, approximately 35-45 minutes.
1. Transfer chicken to a cutting board and allow to rest for 5 to 10 minutes.
1. Carve and serve with sauce.

## Notes

1. For a less spicy sauce, remove the ribs and seeds of the jalapeños before puréeing.
1. Ají amarillo is a Peruvian yellow pepper paste that can be found in most Latin markets. It can be omitted.
