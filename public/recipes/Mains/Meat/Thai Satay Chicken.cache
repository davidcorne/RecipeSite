Thai Satay Chicken
# Thai Satay Chicken # 
  
This recipe is from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GifRecipes/comments/axgmw9/thai_satay_chicken/ehthdgu/). Note, this could easily be made vegan if you used vegan red curry paste (many have fish sauce in) and substituted tofu for the chicken.

## Ingredients

- 400 g/14 oz coconut milk (1 can), full fat
- 13-16 bamboo skewers , 16 cm / 6.5" long (Note 1)

### MARINADE:
- 600 g / 1.2 lb chicken thighs , boneless skinless, cut into 2 cm/4/5" pieces (Note 2)
- 1 tbsp curry powder (Note 3)
- 1 tsp white sugar
- 2 tsp red curry paste (Note 4)
- 1 tsp salt

### THAI PEANUT SAUCE:
- 2 tbsp red curry paste (Note 4)
- ¾ cup natural peanut butter, smooth (Note 5)
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 2 tsp dark soy sauce
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 tbsp cider vinegar
- ¾ cup (185 ml) water

### SERVING
- 2 tbsp peanuts finely chopped
- Lime wedges (optional)
- Coriander leaves and sliced red chili (optional)

# Method

If cooking on a BBQ or over charcoal, soak skewers for 2 hours in water.

### THAI CHICKEN SATAY SKEWERS
1. Mix together the chicken and Marinade with ¼ cup of coconut milk, then set aside for at least 20 minutes, or overnight.
2. Thread onto skewers - I do 4 to 5 pieces each.
3. Heat 1.5 tbsp oil in a large non stick pan over medium high heat.
4. Cook skewers in batches for 3 minutes on each side until golden.

### THAI PEANUT SAUCE

1. Place remaining coconut milk and Peanut Sauce ingredients in a saucepan over medium low heat.
2. Stir to combine then simmer, stirring every now and then, for 5 minutes.
3. Adjust consistency with water - it should be a pour-able but thickish sauce.
4. Cover with lid and keep warm while cooking skewers.

## Notes:
1. Skewers used for Asian chicken satay tend to be shorter than Western skewers. I like them because they fit in skillets! Feel free to make giant ones with longer skewers.
2. Chicken - can be substituted with breast or tenderloin but thigh is best for juiciest chicken. Can also sub with beef or pork - use a good, nicely marbled cut suitable for quick cooking.
3. Curry powder - any is fine here. I use Clives or Keens.
4. Red curry paste - The best Thai red curry paste (in my opinion) is Maesri which comes in small cans and also happens to be the cheapest. Sold at large supermarkets, Asian stores. But any brand will do because it's an enhancer rather than key flavouring.
5. Natural peanut butter is 100% peanuts and has a stronger peanut flavour than commercial peanut butter which has sugar and other additives. It is also thinner so less water is required to achieve the right consistency. Pretty widely available nowadays in the health food section of supermarkets. Can use normal peanut butter spread but the peanut flavour is not as good and sauce will be thicker. Do not be tempted to dilute with too much water - it will dilute the flavour.
6. Peanut Sauce - makes more than you will need, probably only use 1/3.  Hard to make less, also this recipe uses a whole can of coconut milk. Lasts 1 week in the fridge - or freeze. Use leftover for:
    - Sauce for for rice, noodles, veggies (raw or steamed)
    - Make a simple Gado Gado with steam veg, hard boiled eggs and rice
    - Dip for prawn crackers and vegetables
