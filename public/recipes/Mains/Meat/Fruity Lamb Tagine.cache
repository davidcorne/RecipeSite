Fruity lamb tagine
Method
Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Heat the oil in a casserole and
brown the lamb on all sides. Scoop the lamb out onto a plate, then add
the onion and carrots and cook for 2-3 mins until golden. Add the garlic
and cook for 1 min more. Stir in the spices and tomatoes, and season.
Tip the lamb back in with the chickpeas and apricots. Pour over the
stock, stir and bring to a simmer. Cover the dish and place in the oven
for 1 hr.
If the lamb is still a little tough, give it 20 mins more until tender.
When ready, leave it to rest so itâ€™s not piping hot, then serve scattered
with pomegranate and herbs, with couscous or rice alongside.
