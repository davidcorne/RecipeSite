# Jamaican Curry Pork # 

This is inspired by [this recipe](https://www.olivemagazine.com/recipes/meat-and-poultry/jamaican-curry-pork/) but I was a little disappointed with that recipe. This is also made child-safe due to our child's love of [Ella's Kitchen jammin' Jamaican Curried Pork](https://shop.ellaskitchen.co.uk/products/jammin-jamaican-curried-pork-with-peas-rice).

## Ingredients ## 

- vegetable oil for frying
- 2 onions, finely chopped
- 1kg pork shoulder, fat trimmed, and diced
- 2 tbsp allspice
- 1.5 tbsp medium curry powder
- 1 tbsp paprika (not smoked) 
- 1 tbsp ground coriander 
- 1 tbsp garlic granules 
- 4-5 sprigs of thyme, leaves picked
- ¼ tsp black ground peppercorns
- 6 large cloves of garlic , thinly sliced
- 1 scotch bonnet chilli, pierced but left whole
- 2 carrots, sliced
- 1 mango, cut into 1cm squares
- 4 plum tomatoes, roughly chopped
- 4 spring onions, thinly sliced

### Rice and Peas

- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 4 large cloves of garlic, thinly sliced
- 300g long-grain rice
- 25g butter
- 4-5 sprigs of thyme 
- gungo peas or kidney beans 400g tin, drained
- 400ml tin of coconut milk 
- 200ml water

## Method ## 

1. Heat a large pan over a medium-high heat, pour in enough oil to coat the base.
1. Cook the onions for 15 minutes or until translucent.
1. Add the pork, spices, thyme and black pepper, and stir well, coating the meat.
1. Add the garlic, chilli, carrots, mango, tomatoes and most of the spring onions (keep a little back for garnishing).
1. Mix well and pour in 1 litre of cold water to cover the ingredients.
1. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat to low and simmer gently for 2½-3 hours, stirring occasionally and adding a splash of water if it looks a little dry, until the pork is tender.

### Rice and Peas

1. Put a lidded pan over a medium heat with the vegetable oil and cook the onion for 10 minutes until soft.
1. Add the garlic and cook for a minute before adding the rice, butter, thyme, beans and a generous amount of seasoning.
1. Mix well, ensuring the rice is coated in the mixture, then add the coconut milk and water, stirring well.
1. Cover and cook gently for 20 minutes, then remove the lid and cook for a further 15 minutes until the liquid is fully evaporated.

### Serving 

1. Fluff the rice with a fork and serve with the curry pork and reserved spring onions.

## Notes

These are the changes I've made:
- Less curry powder
- Fewer chillies
- More vegetables; added carrots and mangoes
