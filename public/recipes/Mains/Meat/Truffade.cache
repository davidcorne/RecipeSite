Truffade
# Truffade # 

This is a French dish from the Auvergne region, I found this recipe [here](https://sarahskitchen.dukeshillham.co.uk/recipes/by-ingredient/sausage/truffade/).

## Ingredients ## 
- 500g Maris Piper potatoes
- 1 tablespoon duck or goose fat
- 200g Tomme fraiche du Cantal (Comte can be substituted), diced into 1cm pieces
- 1 garlic clove, crushed
- salt and pepper to taste

## Method ## 

1. Peel the potatoes and cut them into 2cm cubes. 
2. Melt the duck fat in a non stick pan.
3. Add the potatoes and season with salt and pepper. 
4. Saute until golden brown over a low to medium heat, around 25 minutes, stirring from time to time to avoid sticking. 
5. For the last few minutes add the garlic.
3. Once the potatoes are cooked, remove them from the heat and crush them with a fork. 
4. Add the cheese, stirring constantly until you get a mixture in which the potatoes are no longer distinguishable from the melted cheese.
4. Serve immediately.
