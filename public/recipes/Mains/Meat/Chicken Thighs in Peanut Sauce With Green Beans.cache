# Chicken Thighs in Peanut Sauce With Green Beans # 

This is a traybake from the [Killing Thyme](https://www.killingthyme.net/2019/01/12/easy-chicken-thighs-in-peanut-sauce-with-green-beans/) site.

## Ingredients ## 

- 2 tbsp olive oil, divided
- ¼ cup smooth peanut butter
- 2 tbsp fresh-squeezed lemon juice
- 4 tbsp orange juice (fresh-squeezed or a good bottled brand works)
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 tbsp Sriracha
- 6 skinless, boneless chicken thighs
- 340g lb green beans
- Kosher salt and cracked black pepper, to taste

## Method ## 

1. Preheat oven to 200°C.
1. Mix 1 tbsp of the olive oil with the ¼ cup peanut butter, 2 tbsp lemon juice, 4 tbsp orange juice, 2 tbsp soy sauce, and 2 tbsp Sriracha in a bowl.
1. Whisk the sauce well, until the peanut butter has dissolved and the mixture is cohesive. (This is easier if the peanut butter is warmed up for 20-30 seconds in the microwave beforehand, but that step is optional.)
1. Place the chicken thighs in the middle of a nonstick baking sheet, ensuring that the chicken thighs are fully flattened.
1. Pour half of the sauce over the thighs; flip the thighs over, then pour the rest of the sauce over the thighs. Make sure the sauce is evenly distributed over the chicken.
1. Place the green beans around the chicken thighs in one layer.
1. Drizzle the remaining olive oil over the beans and season with salt and pepper. Lightly toss with your hands or tongs to evenly coat.
1. Bake the chicken and green beans for 30 minutes or until the chicken thighs are cooked through with an internal temperature of 73°C; the peanut sauce should also be thickened.
1. Serve with rice, or skip the rice and double the amount of green beans cooking them on a separate pan.

## Notes

I made this with skin on thighs, baking them skin side up and it worked very well.
