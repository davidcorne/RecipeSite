# Duck and Fennel Salad #

This is a recipe from [Gressingham](https://www.gressinghamduck.co.uk/recipes/roast-duck-breast-fennel-orange-salad/), and I've modified it only slightly.

## Ingredients ## 
- 2 duck breasts, finely scored
- 1 bulb of fennel, finely sliced
- 1 red onion, finely sliced
- Pack of green beans, topped, blanched and halved (blanching instructions [here](/public/recipes/Mains/Sides/Blanch%20Green%20Beans.html))
- 1 large orange, segmented
- Small bag of watercress
- 1 pomegranate, seeded
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp white wine vinegar
- Salt and pepper

## Method ## 
1. Put the fennel and red onions into a mixing bowl.
2. Add the olive oil, vinegar and season with salt and pepper, then set aside whilst you cook the duck.
3. Season each duck breast generously with salt and place skin side down in a cold non-stick pan on a medium heat without oil for 6-8 minutes or until golden brown.
4. Pour off the fat regularly and seal the other side for 30 seconds.
5. Place the duck breasts skin side up into a preheated oven (180Â°C) and cook for 10 minutes.
6. Remove the duck breasts from the oven and place onto your chopping board for 5 minutes to rest.
7. Whilst the duck is resting, add the green beans, orange segments and juice and pomegranates to the bowl and combine.
8. Just before carving the duck, add the watercress to the salad and gently toss together.
8. Serve the salad in bowls.
8. Carve the two duck breasts finely lengthways.
9. Place the duck breasts on top of the salad, and serve.

## Changes
- I didn't think it needed the 2nd orange for the juice.
- The beans would be better halved.
- The duck was a bit overcooked, I think it would be better without the oven cooking.
- Serve the duck on top of the salad.
