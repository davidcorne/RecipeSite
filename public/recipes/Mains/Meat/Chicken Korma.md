# Chicken Korma #

This is based on a [BBC Good Food](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/slow-cooker-chicken-korma) recipe. I used chicken leg quarters, doubled the recipe and used the oven as I don't have a slow cooker.

## Ingredients ##

- 4 garlic cloves
- thumb-sized piece ginger, peeled
- 4 large onions, finely chopped
- 4 tbsp vegetable oil
- 4 chicken thigh quarters, separated into thighs and drumsticks, skin removed.
- 4 tbsp tomato purée
- 2 tsp ground cumin
- 2 tsp paprika
- 2 tsp turmeric
- 2 tsp ground coriander
- ½ tsp chilli powder
- 600ml chicken stock
- 200ml double cream
- 12 tbsp ground almonds
- toasted flaked almonds , coriander, basmati rice and naan breads, to serve (optional)


## Method ##

1. Heat the oven to 140°C.
1. Put the garlic, ginger and onions in a small blender with a splash of water and whizz to a paste.
1. Heat the oil in a casserole pan over a medium-high heat and sear the chicken all over.
1. Remove from the pan and set aside, then add the onion paste.
1. Fry over a medium heat for 10 mins until lightly golden.
1. Stir in the tomato purée, spices, fry for 1 min until aromatic, then put the chicken back into the pan (with any resting juices) and add the stock.
1. Stir and bring to a simmer, then place into the oven.
1. Cook for 5-6 hrs until the chicken is tender and cooked through.
1. Stir through the cream and the ground almonds and bubble for 10 mins to reduce, if needed.
1. Scatter with flaked almonds and coriander, if using, then serve with rice and naans, if you like.
