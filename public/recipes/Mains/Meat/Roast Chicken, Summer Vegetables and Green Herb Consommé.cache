## Method ##

1. Preheat oven to 220°C. Fill and preheat sous vide machine to 65°C.
1. Place 2 medium saucepans of water over high heat, cover and bring to the boil.
1. For the Parsley Puree, add parsley leaves to one of the pots of boiling water and cook for 4 minutes until vibrant green. The parsley is ready when it breaks down when rubbed between fingertips.
1. Drain leaves then transfer to a small food processor and blitz until smooth. Transfer to a bowl set over an ice bath and set aside to cool completely.
1. For the Chicken Mousse, remove wish bone from whole chicken and remove chicken breast. Remove any sinew from the chicken breast, weigh out 300g and cut into a large dice. Reserve the remaining chicken in a bowl in the fridge for the Raft.
1. Place chicken breast into a pre-chilled food processor bowl, season with salt and blend until smooth. Once smooth add the double cream a little at a time, stopping the food processor to wipe down the sides of the bowl with a spatula to ensure all cream is incorporated.
1. Transfer mixture to a mixing bowl set over an ice bath. Fold in the shallots and herbs. Fold 3 tablespoons of the Parsley Puree into the chicken mousse until vibrant green and well combined.
1. Wrap a small spoonful of the mixture in cling film and roll up like a sausage, then tie the ends.
1. Add the parcel of mousse to one of the pots of boiling water and cook for 4 minutes. Remove from the water, unwrap cling film and taste to check the mousse consistency and seasoning. Add more salt and pepper to the raw mousse if necessary. Transfer remaining mousse to a piping bag and store in the fridge until needed. Reserve the pot of boiling water, covered and boiling, on the heat.
1. For the Chicken, take the brined chicken and, wearing latex gloves, remove the chicken wings by cutting off at the second joint.
1. Run a knife around the base of the chicken legs, 2cm from the end, to expose the bone. Turn the chicken over and score from the neck to the Parson’s nose with a sharp knife. Remove the Parson’s nose.
1. Remove the wishbone.
1. Slide your fingers under the skin on the back of the chicken on both sides of the incision to separate the skin from the flesh, keeping the skin in tact.
1. Holding the leg, push the leg into the chicken, whilst sliding the skin off, ensuring the skin is still attached to the chicken breast. Repeat for the other leg. Remove both legs by cutting between the ball and socket joint at the hip and thigh bone.
1. Turn the chicken around so that the neck is closest to you.
1. Remove the internal bone connected to the wing by cutting with scissors at the wing joint. Pull the wing bone through the skin to remove from the chicken, leaving all the skin intact and still connected to the breast.
1. Using a pair of scissors, cut through the undercarriage on either side as close to the breast as possible, to remove the ribs and back, without cutting into the breast itself. Cut away any remaining undercarriage so that only the crown remains, consisting of 2 breasts, breast bone and all of the chicken skin.
1. Reserve all excess parts of the chicken to make the Consomme.
1. Turn the bird back over, skin side up, and stretch the skin over the work bench. Carefully work your fingers under the skin of the chicken, starting from the neck end until the skin is freed across the breasts, leaving 2cm of skin attached at the bottom end.
1. Remove the Chicken Mousse from the fridge and snip the piping bag tip to 2cm wide.
1. Pipe the mousse in an even layer approximately 1cm thick under the skin of the chicken. Gently press down on the skin covering the crown to evenly spread the mousse over the breasts. Tuck the excess skin around and under the crown to seal the mousse in.
1. Wipe a clean bench with a damp cloth to slightly wet the bench. Lay 4 sheets of clingfilm on top of each other onto the damp workbench to create one strong layer. Place the chicken crown lengthways into the centre of the cling film and wrap the chicken tightly to produce a long ballotine, being careful to maintain an even long tube shape. Tie the neck end of the clingfilm in a tight knot, press out any air and then tie the other end.
1. Place 2 more layers of clingfilm on the bench and repeat the rolling and tieing process, taking care to maintain the shape of the ballotine.
1. Place into the water bath preheated at 65°C and cook for 1 hour, then remove from the water bath and set aside on the bench to cool for 10 minutes.
1. Once cooled slightly, unwrap the chicken and pat dry with paper towel. Sit a roasting tray over a small roasting dish and place the chicken on to the tray. Drizzle and coat the chicken evenly with grapeseed oil and a good sprinkle of salt and pepper.
1. Place the chicken into the oven lengthways, and cook for 11 minutes, then turn the pan around so that the other breast is now facing the back of the oven. Cook until golden and cooked through, a further 11 minutes. Check that the internal temperature of the chicken is between 65°C and 68°C. Once at temperature, remove from the oven and set aside on the wire rack to rest until needed.
1. Meanwhile, for the Consomme, use a cleaver to chop the reserved chicken trim into small pieces. Heat a large, heavy based saucepan over high heat. Add the chicken pieces and fry until golden brown.
1. Take a small, dry frypan and place over high heat. Add the onion halves, cut side down, and char until heavily caramelised.
1. Add the celery, carrot, leek, mushrooms and garlic to the pan with the chicken, and drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil. Lightly sweat off the vegetables, season with salt, then add the charred onion, peppercorns and herbs.
1. Deglaze the pan with the wine, and then reduce by ⅔. Measure out the chicken stock and add to the pan, then bring to the boil.
1. Use a ladle to skim the surface, reduce the heat to a gentle simmer and cook for 30 minutes, occasionally skimming off any fat that may rise to the surface.
1. Sit a large metal bowl over iced water. Strain the chicken consomme stock through a fine sieve into the metal bowl and whisk to cool to 40°C.
1. Meanwhile, for the Herb Oil, place all ingredients into the Thermomix and blend on full speed for 1 minute. Set the Thermomix to temperature 75°C and timer 5 minutes. Turn to speed 6 and blitz until the temperature reaches 75°C. Monitor the temperature and turn off when mixture reaches temperature, which may occur in under 5 minutes.
1. Transfer the mixture to a bowl, sit over iced water and cool as quickly as possible.
1. Pour the cooled puree into a sieve lined with muslin cloth set over a clean bowl and set aside on the bench to allow the oil to drip through.
1. For the Raft, place the reserved chicken breast and herbs into a food processor with a pinch of salt, then add the egg whites and blend until incorporated.
1. Transfer the cooled consomme into a 2.5 litre saucepan. Whisk in the raft mixture. Place over a high heat, stirring with a whisk to ensure the raft is not catching on the bottom of the pan. Cook until the raft has formed firmly on the surface, and, once the first crack appears in the raft, remove from the heat.
1. Use a small ladle to scoop a small hole in the side of the raft to create a venting hole. Place onto a low heat and sit the saucepan on the stove so that the flame is directly under the venting hole. Allow to simmer for 10-15 minutes until the consomme is clear, using the ladle to scoop and maintain the hole in the raft.
1. Strain the clarified consomme through a fine sieve lined with damp muslin cloth. Season with salt. Measure out 30g of the consomme into the serving jug and set aside until needed.
1. For the Summer Vegetables, trim the leaves from the carrots and reserve in a bowl for Garnish. Peel the carrots, then trim the green tops to 1cm. Cut the carrots in half, lengthways, then trim away the tip on an angle to make 5cm lengths.
1. Trim the tops off the radishes and turnips to leave 1cm of stem. Cut the tips of each on a slight angle to neaten. Cut the radishes in half, length ways.
1. Peel the celery. Cut the top ¾ of the celery stalk, on a diagonal, into small half moon shapes.
1. Carefully peel the outer layer from the spring onions and trim the bases into 4cm lengths. Cut each end of the 4cm lengths on an angle.
1. Peel the baby red onions and trim at the root, leaving the root intact. Cut in half, lengthways.
1. Trim the bases of the mushrooms to neaten. Cut mushrooms in half.
1. Trim the sugar snaps by removing the string running along the top of the pod from the base to the tip. Slice into 1cm lengths on the diagonal.
1. Gently rinse all vegetables in a small bowl of water to remove any impurities if required.
1. Heat a small frypan over medium heat. Drizzle with grapeseed oil, and then add the radish, turnip, carrot, celery, spring onions and baby red onions. Add a pinch of salt and cover with the lid. Lightly saute for 10 seconds, swirling the pan, then add 30ml of the chicken stock, cover and continue to cook for 1 minute, swirling the pan. Add a little more stock if required.
1. Add mushrooms and sugar snaps, and a little more stock if required. Cook for a further 2-3 minutes, swirling the pan until vegetables are tender, check and adjusting seasoning as required.
1. Uncover the pan and drizzle vegetables with about 10-15ml of extra virgin olive oil. Continue to cook until pan juices are slightly reduced, then remove from the heat.
1. Place the cooked vegetables onto a small round tray and pour the reduced stock over them to glaze. Count out 5 pieces of sugar snap, 3 baby mushroom halves, 3 baby red onion halves, 3 baby carrot halves, 3 baby radish halves, 3 baby turnips, 3 celery pieces and 2 spring onion lengths and set these aside until needed for plating.
1. Prepare and organise all of the Garnish as per ingredients list, placing on to trays and in bowls as required, in preparation for plating.
1. Take the radish, turnip and carrot and trim stems to 1cm. Cut radish, turnip and carrot in half lengthways from root to stem. Slice thinly on a mandoline to achieve a cross section with stem intact. Reserve 3 slices of each vegetable for plating.
1. Once the Chicken ballotine has rested, carve one of the breasts from the bone. Cut the breast into 6 even slices, on an angle, glaze with a little olive oil and season with salt flakes.
1. To plate, arrange the Summer Vegetables artfully in the serving bowl just off centre. Place 3 slices of Chicken next to the Summer Vegetables, slightly staggered, so the contrast in the mousse under the skin is visible. Place the herbs, leaves, flowers and raw vegetable slices amongst the cooked vegetables.

### To serve:
1. Squeeze 10 drops of the Herb Oil into the jug of Consomme. Pour to one side of the dish and serve immediately.
