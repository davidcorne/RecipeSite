# Roast Chicken & Kidney Beans with Cashew Cocoa Stew # 

This is from the eight bonus recipes from Nik Sharma's [The Flavour Equation](https://niksharma.chroniclebooks.com/).

This should make 4 servings.

## Ingredients

Four (total weight 1½ lb [680g]) skinless, boneless chicken thighs
Fine sea salt
2 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
One medium [260g] white or yellow onion, diced
4 garlic cloves, peeled and minced
2.5 cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and chopped
½ cup [70g] chopped cashews
¼ cup [55g] tomato paste
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp ground chipotle
½ tsp Kashmiri chilli powder
2 cups [480ml] water
One 15½ oz [445g] can kidney beans, drained and rinsed
2 Tbsp unsweetened cocoa
1 oz [28g] bittersweet chocolate (cocoa >70%), chopped
2 Tbsp tamarind paste homemade or store-bought


### Garnish
2 Tbsp minced red onion or shallots
2 Tbsp chopped cilantro leaves
2 Tbsp chopped toasted cashews

## The Flavour Approach

Cocoa adds bitterness and savoriness in the form of glutamate to the dish. Kashmiri chilli powder imparts a nice smokiness to the dish, you can also use ½ tsp smoked paprika with ¼ tsp cayenne to create a similar ﬂavor as a substitute here.

The ﬂavor of this dish improves on aging, make the dish the night before and refrigerate it in an airtight container. Warm the stew the next day, the ﬂavor will be more pronounced.

To toast cashews, heat raw cashews in a dry, stainless-steel skillet over medium-high heat, swirling them around till they start to turn golden brown and release their nutty fragrance, about 5 to 6 minutes.

## Method

1. Pat the chicken thighs dry with clean paper towels. Season with salt on both sides.
1. Heat 1 Tbsp of the oil in a medium stainless-steel saucepan over medium-high heat.
1. Once the oil is hot, add the chicken thighs and brown them on each side, 5 to 8 minutes.
1. Remove from the heat.
1. Heat the remaining 1 Tbsp of oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.
1. Once the oil is hot, sauté the onions until they turn translucent, 4 to 5 minutes.
1. Add the garlic, ginger, and cashews and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute. 
1. Reduce the heat to medium-low, add the tomato paste, and cook until it starts to turn brown, 2 to 3 minutes.
1. Add the cinnamon, chipotle, and chilli and cook until fragrant, 30 to 45 seconds.
1. Stir in 2 cups [480 ml] water, increase the heat to medium-high, and bring to a boil.
1. Remove from the heat and transfer the contents of the saucepan to a blender.
1. Pulse for a few seconds on high speed until you get a smooth purée.
1. Return the purée to the same saucepan and heat over medium-high heat.
1. Add the kidney beans and chicken with the pan juices.
1. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and cook until the chicken is completely cooked and tender, 20 to 30 minutes.
1. Remove the chicken from the saucepan, shred it with a fork, and return it to the saucepan.
1. Stir in the cocoa, chocolate, and tamarind paste until combined.
1. Remove from the heat and taste and season with salt.
1. Garnish with onion, cilantro, and cashews.
1. Serve hot with rice and plain unsweetened Greek yogurt.
