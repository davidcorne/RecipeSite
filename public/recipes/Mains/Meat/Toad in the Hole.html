# Toad in the Hole #

This dinner has always been a favourite of mine. A great winter evening meal
as it's very hearty. Also great for most picky eaters. This is a slight twist
on my mum's toad in the hole, as I wrap bacon around the sausages and add
mustard to the batter.

## Ingredients ## 

- 6 good quality sausages should be around 400g
- 6 rashers of streaky bacon
- 2 tablespoons of flavourless oil (groundnut is best, but sunflower or olive oil will do)
- 2 cloves of garlic, pressed or chopped finely.
- Yorkshire pudding batter.
- 2 teaspoons of mustard.

## Method ##

1. Preheat the oven to 200Â°C.
2. Make up the batter. Stir the mustard into the batter.
3. Remove excess fat from the bacon and Wrap the sasuages in bacon. Make sure to prick the sausages so they release fat during cooking.
3. Arrange the sausages in a large and deep roasting tin (the one I use is about 35 x 25 cm). 
4. Place this in the oven for 5 minutes.
5. After the 5 minutes check that the sausages have released enough oil, if not add the flavourless oil.
6. Add the garlic to the tin now.
6. Cook for a further 5 minutes.
7. When the tin is really hot and the oil has started to simmer, pour the batter over it covering the sausages.
8. Return to the oven and cook for 20 minutes.

## Alternative ##

If you are using a metal roasting tin (mine is ceramic) you can cook the
sausages over a direct heat to start with. For this you cook the sausages for
the first 10 minutes over a medium heat. This means you can get the oil to a
better tempreture and it will not burn away so it's possible to use less of
it.
