# Chinese Duck Curry # 

This was made with a modified version of the sauce from [here](http://allrecipes.co.uk/recipe/28375/chinese-curry-sauce.aspx).

## Ingredients ## 
- 1 roasted peking duck (follow roast duck, but rub with Chinese five spice first) taken apart and the meat cut up.
- 3 red onions
- 4 decent sized potatoes
- 1 teaspoon tumeric
- 1 tablespoon Chinese five spice powder
- 1 tablespoon of soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons oil, plus some for the pan

### For the Sauce
- 1½ litres chicken stock
- 3 tablespoons cornflour (mixed with sufficient cold water to make a paste)
- 2 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon Chinese five spice powder
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- ½ teaspoon mild chilli powder
- 4 teaspoons mild curry powder

## Method ## 

1. Marinade the duck in a tablespoon of oil, Chinese five spice and soy sauce.
2. Cut the potatoes into roughly 2cm cubes, and coat with a tablespoon of oil and the tumeric.
3. Quarter the onions.
4. Oil and heat a deep pan on a medium heat.
5. Cook the potatoes for around 10 minutes, stirring frequently so they don't stick
6. Add the onion quarters and cook for a further 10 minutes, stirring so that they break up.
7. Add the chicken stock, and mix in the cornflour.
8. Add the duck and the soy sauce and spices for the sauce, simmering for a further 15 minutes to allow the flavours to blend and infuse the meat.
9. Enjoy!
