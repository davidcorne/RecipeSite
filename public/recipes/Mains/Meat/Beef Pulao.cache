## The Flavour Approach

Browning the pieces of beef before they are added to the rice creates a richer meaty ﬂavor for the pulao via the caramelization and the Maillard reactions. 

Yogurt provides a hint of sourness and forms the basis for the spice mixture.

Aromatic spices such as cardamom and cinnamon merge with the aroma of the meat created by the fat and proteins as they cook, adding a pleasant fragrance.

## Method ## 

1. Heat 2 Tbsp of the oil in a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
2. When the oil is hot, add the 1 tsp cumin seeds and cook until they turn brown and fragrant, 30 to 45 seconds.
3. Add the 2 onions and fry until they just start to turn brown, 8 to 12 minutes.
4. Season the beef cubes with salt and fry with the onions until the meat starts to brown and the juices cook off, 8 to 12 minutes.
5. In a small bowl, mix the 240g yogurt with the 1 tsp black pepper, 1 tsp coriander, 1 tsp chilli, and ½ tsp turmeric and add this to the beef.
6. Add the 2 bay leaves and ½ cup [120 ml] water, season with salt, and stir to coat evenly.
7. Reduce the heat to low, cover the saucepan, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the beef is thoroughly cooked, 30 to 45 minutes.
8. Transfer the cooked beef mixture to a large bowl and set aside. 
9. While the beef cooks, clean and pick through the rice for any stones or debris.
10. Rinse the rice in a fne mesh sieve under running water until the runoff is no longer cloudy.
11. Transfer to a large bowl, cover with 4 cups [960ml] of water, and soak for 30 minutes.
12. Wipe the saucepan clean and heat the remaining 2 Tbsp of oil over medium-high heat.
11. Add the 2 cinnamon sticks, 1 tsp cardamom, 4 cloves, and ginger and saute until the spices are fragrant, 30 to 45 seconds.
12. Drain the rice, add it to the saucepan, and fry until the rice starts to stick to the bottom of the pan.
13. Add 2 cups [480ml] water.
14. Season with salt and stir gently with a spatula.
15. Add the beef mixture on top of the rice.
16. Bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat to low.
17. Cover the pan and cook until all the water is absorbed, and the rice is completely cooked, 30 to 40 minutes.
18. Remove from the heat and let rest for 10 minutes.
19. To serve, fluff the rice with a fork and redistribute the beef.
20. Garnish with the chopped cilantro and chilli.
