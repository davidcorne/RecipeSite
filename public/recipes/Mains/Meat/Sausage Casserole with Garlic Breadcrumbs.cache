This is a recipe from the 2020 October edition of BBC Good Food. There is also a link to it on the [good food website](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/one-pot-sausage-casserole-with-garlic-breadcrumbs).

## Ingredients ## 

- 3 tbsp olive oil, plus an extra drizzle (optional)
- 8 large pork sausages
- 1 onion, finely sliced
- sprinkle of golden caster sugar
- 1 tbsp red wine vinegar
- 1 tbsp tomato puree
- ½ tsp smoked paprika
- 400g can chopped tomatoes
- 100ml red wine
- 2 bay leaves
- 400g can butter beans, drained but not rinsed


### For the crumb topping (optional)

- 50g fresh breadcrumbs
- 2 garlic cloves, finely grated
- handful of parsley leaves, roughly chopped

## Method ## 

1. Heat the oven to 220°C/200°C fan.
1. Heat 1 tbsp of the oil in a shallow ovenproof casserole over a medium heat and gently fry the sausages for 5-8 mins, or until brown on all sides.
1. Transfer to a plate using tongs.
1. Tip the onions into the pan and fry for 5-8 mins until beginning to turn golden.
1. Drizzle in a little more oil if the onions start to stick.
1. Sprinkle in the sugar and cook for a minute before stirring in the vinegar, tomato puree and paprika to form a paste.
1. Tip in the tomatoes, then pour the wine into the tomato can, swish it round, and add to the pan.
1. Stir in the bay leaves and beans, then arrange the sausages on top so they’re half-submerged in the sauce but still a little exposed.
1. Bring the mixture to a simmer, then bake in the oven for 20 mins.
1. Meanwhile, make the topping: Mix the breadcrumbs with the garlic and parsley, then season and stir in 1 tbsp oil.
1. Scatter the topping over the casserole, then drizzle with the remaining 1 tbsp oil and bake for 10 mins more until the breadcrumbs are golden and crisp.
1. Leave to stand for a few minutes, then take to the table and serve from the dish.
