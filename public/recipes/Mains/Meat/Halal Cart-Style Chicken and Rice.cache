## Why it Works

- Chicken thighs are less prone to drying out like chicken breast can be, guaranteeing tender and juicy results.
- A combination of mayonnaise and Greek yogurt, plus seasonings, nail that classic halal-cart white sauce.
- Iceberg lettuce and tomato may seem like strange additions, but they're essential elements of this famous New York City street food.

- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano
- ½ teaspoon ground coriander seed
- 3 garlic cloves, roughly chopped (about 1½ tablespoons)

- 590ml chicken broth
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

### The Sauce

- ½ cup mayonnaise
- ½ cup Greek yogurt
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 2 tablespoons white vinegar
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- ¼ cup chopped fresh parsley
- 2 tsp black pepper
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

### To Serve

- 1 head iceberg lettuce, shredded

## Method ## 

### Chicken Marinade

1. Combine the lemon juice, oregano, coriander, garlic, and olive oil in a blender.
1. Blend until smooth.
1. Season the marinade to taste with kosher salt and black pepper.
1. Place the chicken in a 1-gallon zipper-lock bag and add half of the marinade (reserve the remaining marinade in the refrigerator).
1. Turn the chicken to coat, seal the bag, and marinate the chicken in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours, turning occasionally to redistribute the marinade (see Note).

### Chicken 1st Cooking

1. Remove the chicken from the bag and pat it dry with paper towels.
1. Season with kosher salt and pepper, going heavy on the pepper.
1. Heat the oil in a 12-inch heavy-bottomed cast iron or stainless-steel skillet over medium-high heat until it is lightly smoking.
1. Add the chicken pieces and cook without disturbing until they are lightly browned on the first side, about 4 minutes. Using tongs, flip the chicken.
1. Reduce the heat to medium and cook until the chicken is cooked through and the center of each thigh registers 74°C. on an instant-read thermometer, about 6 minutes longer.
1. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and allow to cool for 5 minutes.
1. Using a chef’s knife, roughly chop the chicken into ½ to ¼ inch chunks.
1. Transfer to a medium bowl, add the remaining marinade, cover loosely with plastic, and refrigerate while you cook the rice and prepare the sauce.

### Rice

1. Melt the butter over medium heat in a large Dutch oven.
1. Add the turmeric and cumin and cook until fragrant but not browned, about 1 minute.
1. Add the rice and stir to coat. Cook, stirring frequently, until the rice is lightly toasted, about 4 minutes.
1. Add the chicken broth and season to taste with salt and pepper.
1. Raise the heat to high and bring to a boil.
1. Cover, reduce to a simmer, and cook for 15 minutes without disturbing.
1. Remove from the heat and allow to rest until the water is completely absorbed and the rice is tender, about 15 minutes.

### Sauce

1. In a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise, yogurt, sugar, vinegar, lemon juice, parsley, and 2 teaspoons black pepper.
1. Whisk to combine.
1. Season to taste with salt.

### Serving

1. Return the entire contents of the chicken bowl (chicken, marinade, and all juices) to the skillet.
1. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until heated through. 
1.Divide the rice, lettuce, tomato, and toasted pita bread evenly among four to six plates. 
1. Pile the chicken on top of the rice.
1. Top with the white sauce and hot sauce.
1. Serve immediately, passing extra sauce at the table.

## Notes

Do not marinate the chicken longer than 4 hours or it’ll get a mushy texture. If you must delay cooking the chicken for any reason, remove it from the marinade, pat it dry with paper towels, and refrigerate until ready to cook.
