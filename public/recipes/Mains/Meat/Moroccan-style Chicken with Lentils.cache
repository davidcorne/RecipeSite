Moroccan-style chicken with
lentils
Method
Heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4. Rub 1 tbsp olive oil into the
chicken thighs. Mix the garlic, cumin, coriander and paprika
together, then rub all over the chicken thighs on both sides.
Heat a large flameproof casserole, add the chicken thighs and
cook over a medium heat for 5 mins until golden on both sides. You
might need to do this in 2 batches, depending on the size of the
casserole. Set the chicken aside. Turn down the heat, add the
remaining oil and fry the onion for 5 mins until softened.
Stir in the rest of the ingredients, apart from the mint and bring to
the boil. Place the chicken thighs on top and pour in any juices.
Cover and cook for 1Â½ hrs, until the meat is tender and the sauce
thickened. Can be cooled and frozen at this stage for up to 1 month.
Defrost thoroughly in the fridge, then gently warm through. Scatter
