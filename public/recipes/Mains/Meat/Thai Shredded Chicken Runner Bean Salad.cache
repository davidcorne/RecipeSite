## Method ##

1. Run a potato peeler down either side of the beans to remove any stringy bits.
1. Cut into strips using a bean slicer, or on the diagonal into 2cm pieces.
1. Cook the beans in simmering salted water for 4 mins or until tender but still bright green.
1. Drain and put in a bowl with the chilli, shallots, lemongrass and ginger.
1. Pull the chicken breasts into shreds using your fingers and add to the bowl.
1. Make the dressing by mixing the coconut with the garlic, fish sauce, sugar, lime and chilli.
1. Tear the mint and Thai basil over the chicken and toss everything together.
1. Pile onto a plate and pour over the dressing. Serve with the lime to squeeze over and jasmine rice.
