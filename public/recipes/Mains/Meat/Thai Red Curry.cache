# Thai Red Curry #
  
  This is a heavily modified [BBC Good Food](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/thai-red-curry) recipe.
  
## Ingredients ## 

- 1 tbsp oil, rapeseed or vegetable ideally
- 2 onions, finely diced
- 1 thumb sized piece of ginger, finely diced
- 2 cloves of garlic, finely diced
    - these can be substituted for 1 tbsp ginger & garlic paste
- 1 red chilli, seeds removed and finely diced
- coriander stems from 1 bunch of coriander, finely diced
- 5-6 tbsp red curry paste
- 800ml coconut milk
- 3 tbsp fish sauce
- 1 tsp brown sugar
- lime juice, from 1 lime
- coriander leaves from 1 bunch of coriander, roughly chopped

### Protein
This works well with quick cooking protein, I would suggest one of:

  - 8 skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into large chunks, or
  - 4 fish fillets, or
  - 2 fish fillets and 250 raw peeled prawns

### To Serve

- 1 red chilli, sliced diagonally
- thumb-sized piece ginger, cut into matchsticks
- lime quarters
- cooked jasmine rice, to serve

## Method ## 

1. Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat and fry the 2 diced onions until translucent, about 5 minutes.
1. Add the diced ginger, garlic, chilli and coriander stems, and fry until very aromatic, about 2 minutes.
1. Add 5-6 tbsp red curry paste, sizzle for another minute.
1. Pour in the 800ml coconut milk.
1. Bring to the boil, reduce to a simmer, stir a little and wait for the oil to rise to the surface (should be about 2 minutes).
1. If you are using chicken, add it now and simmer for 12 mins or until the chicken is cooked through.
1. Add 3 tbsp of fish sauce and 1 tsp of brown sugar, then taste – if you like it a little saltier, add more fish sauce; if you like it sweeter, add a little more sugar.
1. If using fish, add it now and simmer until cooked (~2-4 minutes depending on the size of the fillets)
1. Take off the heat and add the lime juice and coriander leaves.
1. Spoon the curry into four bowls and top with 1 red chilli, a thumb-sized piece of ginger and the lime quarters.
1. Serve with jasmine rice.
