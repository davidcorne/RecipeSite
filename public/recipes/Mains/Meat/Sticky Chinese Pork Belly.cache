## Ingredients ##

- 1 kg rindless pork belly slices chopped in half (each piece being approx. the length of your index finger)
- 1 litre hot chicken stock
- 1 thumb sized piece of ginger peeled and minced (or 1 tbsp of ginger puree)
- 3 cloves garlic peeled and roughly chopped
- 1 tbsp rice wine
- 1 tbsp caster sugar

### Glaze ###

- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- pinch salt and pepper
- 1 thumb-sized piece of ginger peeled and minced
- 1 red chilli finely chopped
- 2 tbsp honey
- 2 tbsp brown sugar
- 3 tbsp dark soy sauce
- 1 tsp lemon grass paste

## Method ##

1. Add pork belly slices, stock, ginger, garlic, rice wine, and sugar to a heavy-based pan. I use a cast iron casserole pan.
1. Bring to the boil, then place a lid on, turn down the heat and simmer for 2 hours.
1. Turn off the heat, remove the pork from the pan and pat it dry using kitchen towels. You can reserve the liquid if you like (Perfect for a Thai or Chinese noodle soup).
1. Chop the pork into bite sized chunks.
1. In a small bowl, mix together 1 tbsp vegetable oil, 1 thumb-sized piece of ginger, 1 red chilli, 2 tbsp honey, 2 tbsp brown sugar, 3 tbsp dark soy sauce, 1 tsp lemon grass paste.
1. Add the remaining 1 tbsp of oil to a frying pan and heat over a medium-high heat.
1. Add in the pork, along with a pinch of salt and pepper, and fry, turning regularly, until the pork starts to turn golden. Be careful as the oil can splatter at this stage (I recommend a splatter guard).
1. Now pour the glaze over the pork and continue to cook for a couple of minutes, turning the pork often, until the pork looks dark and sticky.
1. Remove from the heat and serve. I like to top with a few spring onions and chopped chillies.
