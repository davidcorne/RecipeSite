# Roast Lamb Studded with Rosemary and Garlic #

This is a [BBC Good Food](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/roast-lamb-studded-rosemary-garlic) recipe.

## Ingredients ##

- leg of lamb weighing 2.5kg/5lb 8oz
- 1 garlic bulb
- 1 bunch rosemary
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- 2 carrots, cut into large chunks
- 1 onion, cut into quarters
- 1 glass red wine (about 150ml)
- 1.2l beef or lamb stock

## Method ##

1. Using a sharp pointed knife, make at least 30 small incisions all over the leg of lamb.
1. Take 4 cloves from 1 bulb of garlic, peel and thinly slice them, then prod a slice into each incision.
1. Next, take 1 bunch of rosemary, pull off small sprigs and push into the incisions, too.
1. If done in advance, cover the leg of lamb well and refrigerate. Remove from the fridge 1 hr before roasting.
1. Heat oven to 190°C/170°C fan.
1. Heat a large frying pan, add 1 tbsp vegetable oil and brown the leg of lamb all over.
1. Scatter 2 carrots, cut into large chunks, 1 quartered onion, the remaining garlic and rosemary in a large roasting tin, pour in 1 glass of red wine and 1.2l beef or lamb stock, then place the browned lamb in the tin.
1. Roast for about 1 hr 45 mins. Turn the leg of lamb halfway through so by the time it’s cooked, each side has been in the stock.
