# Arroz con Pollo # 

This is a traditional Peruvian recipe, from [Simply](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/arroz_con_pollo/). It would go well with the [green sauce](public/recipes/Mains/Meat/Peruvian-Style%20Grilled%20Chicken%20With%20Green%20Sauce.md).

## Ingredients ## 

### Chicken

- 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 1 broiler-fryer chicken, about 2 ½-3 pounds, cut into serving pieces, or 2 ½ to 3 pounds chicken thighs or breasts, bone-in, with skin on, rinsed and patted dry
- ½ cup flour, for dredging
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Paprika

### Rice

- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (can use up to ¼ cup)
- 1 medium yellow onion, chopped
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 2 cups medium or long-grain white rice
- 3 cups chicken stock (see note above about the ratio of liquid to rice)
- 1 heaping tablespoon tomato paste or 1 cup diced fresh or cooked tomatoes, strained
- Pinch oregano
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt

## Method ## 

1. Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large 12-inch skillet that has a cover on medium high heat.
1. Put the flour in a wide bowl, mix in a generous sprinkling of salt, pepper, and paprika. 
1. Dredge the chicken pieces lightly in the flour mixture and put them in the pan to brown.
1. Cook a few minutes on each side, just enough so that the chicken has browned. Use a slotted spoon to remove from pan and set aside.
1. Add the uncooked rice to the pan to brown.
1. Stir to coat the rice with olive oil in the pan. Add a little more olive oil if necessary.
1. Don't stir too much or you will prevent it from browning. Let the rice brown and then stir a little to let more of it brown.
1. Add the onion and garlic to the pan. Cook the onion, garlic, and rice mixture, stirring frequently, until the onions have softened, about 4 minutes.
1. Place the chicken pieces, skin side up, on top of the rice.
1. In a separate bowl, mix together the stock, tomato, salt, and oregano. Pour the stock mixture over the rice and chicken.
1. Adding stock and tomato to a skillet for pollo chicken.
1. Simmer, covered:
1. Bring to a simmer, reduce the heat to low, and cover. Let cook for 20 to 25 minutes, depending on the type of rice and the instructions on the rice package, until the rice and chicken are done.
1. Fluff the rice with a fork. If you want you can sprinkle with some peas. Add more salt and pepper to taste.
