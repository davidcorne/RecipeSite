4. Meanwhile, heat a frying pan until hot and fry the bacon, shallots and
garlic for 4-5 minutes, or until golden-brown. Deglaze the pan with the
white wine and continue to cook until most of the liquid has
evaporated.

the bacon mixture. Pour over the double cream. Season with salt and
lots of freshly ground black pepper. Layer the Reblochon slices on top.

brown and bubbling.
