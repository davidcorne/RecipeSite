# Beef Rendang Turmeric Rice #

This is a [BBC Good Food](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/beef-rendang-turmeric-rice) recipe. I served it with the yellow rice from the [Halal Cart Chicken and Rice](/public/recipes/Mains/Meat/Halal%20Cart-Style%20Chicken%20and%20Rice.md), rather than the tumeric rice recipe in that link.

## Ingredients ##

- 3 tbsp vegetable oil
- 2kg beef shin or skirt, cut into bite-sized cubes
- 2 lemongrass stalks, bashed
- 2 x 400ml cans coconut milk
- 250ml water
- 4 tbsp desiccated coconut
- 2 kaffir lime leaves, torn
- 1 ½ tbsp chicken stock powder (I used a stock pot for 500ml of stock)
- 2 tbsp tamarind paste
- 1 tsp golden caster sugar
- ¼ tsp salt

### For the paste

- 15 dry chillies (I used 5 large dried chillis, it was reasonably hot)
- 6-8 baby shallots
- thumb-sized piece ginger, chopped
- thumb-sized piece galangal, peeled and chopped (use ginger if you can’t find it)
- 3 lemongrass stalks, chopped

## Method ##

1. For the paste:
    1. Soak the chillies in boiling water for 15 mins.
    1. Drain, remove seeds and whizz with the rest of the paste ingredients in a small food processor until smooth.
1. Heat the oil in a wok or a heavy-based flameproof casserole dish.
1. Fry the paste for 5 mins until the aroma is released.
1. Add the beef and the lemongrass, and mix well.
1. Once the beef starts to lose its pinkness, add the coconut milk and 250ml water.
1. Bring to the boil, then lower to a simmer, uncovered. Stir occasionally to avoid sticking, and more often towards the end.
1. Meanwhile, toast the coconut in a frying pan on a low heat for 5-7 mins until golden brown.
1. Set aside to cool. Using a blender, coarsely blend it to finer pieces – but not too fine. Put to one side.
1. After 2 hrs, add the coconut, kaffir lime leaves, chicken stock powder, tamarind paste, sugar and salt to the pan.
1. Simmer for 30 mins more. You should start to see the oil separating from the mix.
1. It’s ready when the meat is tender and almost falling apart.
