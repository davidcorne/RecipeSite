## Ingredients ## 

- 500g Linguine, De Cecco
- 300g Pancetta
- 2 whole eggs, 1 yolk
- 150g Grana Pandano
- Freshly ground black pepper

## Method ## 

1. Cut the pancetta in small cubes, not to small because they will burn and not to big so that it will be crispy and cooked all the way through. Approximately 1cm. Place it in a preheated saut√© pan, on medium heat. The pan should have some height to it, so the pasta can be incorporated into it.
2. When the fat of the pancetta is rendered, approximately 5 minutes in, put the pasta in the boiling salted water.
3. Whisk the eggs with the Padano in a bowl, thoroughly so no traces of egg whites can be seen in the mixture. Set aside.
4. When the pasta is finished, ten minutes approximately, the pancetta should have a nice golden brown colour and crunchy texture. Save a cup of the pasta water and strain the pasta. Drop them in the pancetta, mix thoroughly and coat with fat all the pasta. Grind about two teaspoons of black pepper and incorporate within the pasta. Toss and mix them well.
5. At this point take the pan of the heat, put all the mixture of eggs and cheese in and start mixing and tossing the pasta thoroughly and vigorously. Continue for about forty five seconds or maybe a minute, until you see the pasta coated with the eggs and cheese, giving them a shiny and rich texture. The pasta water serves the purpose of helping us achieve that texture, so maybe add little by little to check the consistency. If not right return to the hob, in low heat to make it right.
