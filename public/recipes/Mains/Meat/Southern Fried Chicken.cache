Southern fried chicken
Method
Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Put the chicken in a bowl
and pour over the milk. Tip the flour and spices into a large plastic
bag and add a large pinch of salt and a good grinding of pepper.
Heat half the oil in a large frying pan. Take half of the chicken
out of the milk, shake off any excess and put in the bag of seasoned
flour. Hold the top closed and shake well. Lift the pieces out and
shake off any excess, but don’t do this too hard or you’ll end up with
no coating. Lower the pieces into the oil and fry on each side until
golden and crisp – don’t overdo it as the chicken is being baked
next and will brown further. Use tongs to turn the chicken and try not
to tear the coating. Transfer to a rack set in a roasting tin. Repeat
with the rest of the chicken.
Bake for 30 mins until cooked – check one drumstick and one
thigh with a skewer – cook for longer if you need to.
