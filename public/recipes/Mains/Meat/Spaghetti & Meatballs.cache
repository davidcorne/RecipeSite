Spaghetti & meatballs
Method
First make the meatballs. Split the sausage skins and squeeze
out the meat into your largest mixing bowl. Add the mince, onion,
parsley, Parmesan, breadcrumbs, beaten eggs and lots of
seasoning. Get your hands in and mix together really well – the
more you squeeze and mash the mince, the more tender the
meatballs will be.
Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Roll the mince mixture into
about 50 golf-ball-size meatballs. Set aside any meatballs for
freezing, allowing about 5 per portion, then spread the rest out in a
large roasting tin – the meatballs will brown better if spaced out a
bit. Drizzle with a little oil (about 1 tsp per portion), shake to coat,
then roast for 20-30 mins until browned.
Meanwhile, make the sauce. Heat the oil in your largest pan.
Add the garlic and sizzle for 1 min. Stir in the tomatoes, wine, if
using, sugar, parsley and seasoning. Simmer for 15-20 mins until

slightly thickened. Stir in the basil leaves, if using, spoon out any
