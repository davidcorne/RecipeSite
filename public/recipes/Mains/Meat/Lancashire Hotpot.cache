Lancashire hotpot
Method
Heat oven to 160C/fan 140C/gas 3. Heat some dripping or
butter in a large shallow casserole dish, brown the lamb in batches,
lift to a plate, then repeat with the kidneys.
Fry the onions and carrots in the pan with a little more dripping
until golden. Sprinkle over the flour, allow to cook for a couple of
mins, shake over the Worcestershire sauce, pour in the stock, then
bring to the boil. Stir in the meat and bay leaves, then turn off the
heat. Arrange the sliced potatoes on top of the meat, then drizzle
with a little more dripping. Cover, then place in the oven for about
1Â½ hrs until the potatoes are cooked.
Remove the lid, brush the potatoes with a little more dripping,
then turn the oven up to brown the potatoes, or finish under the grill
for 5-8 mins until brown.
