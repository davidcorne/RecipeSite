## Method ## 

### Choux Pastry

1. Line a large baking tray with parchment and preheat the oven to 200°C (Fan 180°C).
2. Sift the flour onto a plate and sprinkle the sugar over the top. Set this aside.
3. Crack the eggs into another bowl, beat them and set these aside too.
4. Put the butter and water into a saucepan and bring to the boil.
5. Remove the pan from the heat, quickly add the prepared flour and mix together well.
6. Return the pan to a gentle heat, stirring vigorously for 30 seconds to make a soft dough.
7. Remove the pan again, add half the prepared egg and beat it into the dough.
8. Beat in the remaining egg to make a thick, smooth paste.

### Choux Buns

1. Spoon or pipe the dough into your chosen shape on the prepared baking tray.
2. Bake for 15 - 35 minutes according to size and until golden brown and dry on the inside.
3. Remove the tray from the oven and make a cut in the side of each choux bun to allow the steam to escape, and transfer to a wire rack to cool.
4. When completely cold slice and fill the buns with a sweet or savoury filling.
