CHEWY GINGER FLAPJACKS
 
Chewy ginger low FODMAP flapjacks. Always a great recipe to have in your back pocket for the holiday season - or
any time for that matter.
Gather
175g unsalted butter (lactose free or dairy free if needed)
1 tbsp maple syrup
150g demerara sugar
1 tsp ground ginger
250g rolled oats (gluten free if needed)
75g stem ginger, chopped
Pinch of sea salt
Make
1. Preheat the oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4 and grease and line an 8inch square tin with baking parchment.
2. Place the butter, maple syrup, sugar and ground ginger in a large heavy-based saucepan. Heat gently, stirring
often, until the butter has just melted.
3. Remove from the heat and pour in the rolled oats, salt and chopped stem ginger.
4. Mix together with a wooden spoon until thoroughly combined.
5. Turn the mixture into your prepared baking tray, spread evenly and push down with the back of your spoon.
6. For chewy flapjacks, bake for 20 minutes, until a light golden colour. Bake for a bit longer if you like your
flapjacks a bit more crispy.
7. Once baked, carefully run a knife round the edge of the tin to release the flapjack, leave for a few minutes, then
cut into squares. Leave in the tin until nearly cold before re-cutting the pieces.
8. The flapjacks will keep in an airtight tin for up to 10 days.
