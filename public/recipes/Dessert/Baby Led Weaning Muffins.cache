## Ingredients ## 

### Muffins

- 75g Apple peeled, cored and diced, (medium eating apple)
- 50g carrot (1 small-medium)
- 50g Banana (equiv of small bobby banana)
- 1 eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 25g melted butter or oil (optional)
- 80g standard flour (1 ¼ cup)

- 1½ cups whole milk yogurt
- 2-3 tablespoons maple syrup

## Method ## 

### Muffins

1. Peel and grate carrot, place apple and carrot in a pot with a little water, pop a lid on and 1. simmer until apple soft. Usually 5-6 mins.
1. While apple and carrot cooking, place banana in a large bowl, mash with a fork.
1. Add eggs, vanilla, and butter/oil.
1. Puree the cooked apple and carrot, I use a stick blender.
1. Add apple and carrot to the other wet ingredients.
1. Beat these wet ingredients together with a hand-held beater, should become smooth, yellow and a 1. little frothy.
1. Add the flour and baking powder.
1. Beat for a further 30-60 seconds to make a well-mixed batter.
1. Portion into an oiled muffin tin (I use a non-stick silicon tray sprayed with oil) Mix makes 15 mini muffins.
1. Bake at 180°C for 15 mins
1. Cool the muffins

### Icing

1. Place 1½ cups whole milk yogurt in a sieve or fine-mesh strainer lined with a paper towel with a bowl underneath.
1. Let sit for 30 minutes or up to overnight.
1. Transfer the yogurt to a bowl and stir in 2-3 tablespoons maple syrup and ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract.
1. Refrigerate until ready to use.

1. These muffins can be stored in an airtight container for 3 days, or they can be frozen.

## Notes

This recipe is successful without the butter/oil, but you getter a softer muffin with it, and they remain softer for longer with the added butter or oil
To make the recipe dairy free, substitute the melted butter for a mild tasting vegetable oil.
