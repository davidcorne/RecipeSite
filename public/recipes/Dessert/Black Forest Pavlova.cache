Black Forest Pavlova
# Black Forest Pavlova # 

The meringue is originally from [here](https://www.lurpak.com/en/recipes/black-forest-pavlova/), the rest is all my own.

## Ingredients ## 

### Meringue

- 8 egg whites
- 450g caster sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 tbsp cocoa powder

### Construction 

- 500g black forest fruits (frozen works very well here)
- ~200g chocolate chips (I didn't 100% measure this)
- 1 tbsp coconut oil
- A few squares of chocolate, peeled into curls

### Creme Chantilly

- 300ml double cream
- 2 tbsp icing sugar
- a few drops vanilla essence

## Method ## 

### Meringue

1. Preheat the oven to 180°C. 
2. Line 2 baking trays with greaseproof paper.
3. Beat the egg whites with an electric whisk on high speed until stiff.
4. Gradually beat in the sugar and continue to whisk until the sugar has dissolved and the meringue is glossy. 
5. Beat in the vanilla.
6. Sift the cocoa powder.
7. Spoon half of the meringue mixture onto each baking tray.
8. Place the baking trays in the oven and immediately reduce the oven temperature to 150°C.
9. Bake for 60-90 minutes until dry and firm. At this stage the meringue should have a firm base and sound hollow when tapped.
10. Turn off oven and leave to cool inside.

### Assembly

Start this only when both meringues are cool to the touch.

1. Heat the chocolate and coconut oil using a double boiler.
2. When it's melted, pour slightly less than half on the meringue you will use for the base layer, and spread it around. Then return it to the double boiler.
3. Quickly put half the fruit onto the chocolate while it's still soft, so that it sticks in place.
4. Carefully lay the top meringue onto the base.
5. Spread the remaining chocolate onto the top, you can pool it by the edges to get a more drip cake effect.
6. While the chocolate is still soft arrange the remaining fruit on top, and sprinkle with the chocolate curls.
