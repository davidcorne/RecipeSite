This no bake cheesecake has an Oreo® biscuit base with a creamy white chocolate ñlling. Perfect for any
cheesecake lover.
Ingredients
Serves: 6
150g Oreo® cookies, with the centre ñlling put to one side
55g butter
60g caster sugar
80ml double cream
150g cream cheese
4 squares white chocolate
1 extra Oreo® cookie
Preparation method
Prep: 15 min | Extra time: 30 min
1.Crush the Oreo® cookies to crumbs whilst melting down the butter. Mix together and add one tablespoon
of the caster sugar. Spread in the bottom of a greased dish and leave in the fridge to chill.
 
2.Whip the cream until soft peaks and set aside.
 
3.Beat the cream cheese and remaining sugar together, adding in the Oreo® creme ñlling. Melt the white
chocolate and add to the cream cheese mix. Fold in the whipped cream and mix well.
 
4.Take the Oreo® base from the fridge and spread the cream and cheese mix on top of the base.
 
5.Crush the last Oreo® cookie to dust and sprinkle on top. Leave in the fridge for 20 to 30 minutes before
serving.
 
Make it healthier
Leave out the sugar when preparing the base for a lovely bittersweet taste. You can leave out the chocolate
altogether by substituting it with a few drops of vanilla òavouring.
Tip
Crush one extra Oreo cookie to dust and mix into the cream cheese mix for an Oreo òavour throughout the
cheesecake.
