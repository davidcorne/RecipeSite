## Ingredients ## 

- 240g butter, melted and cooled
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 260g white sugar
- 200g packed light brown sugar
- 4 large eggs, at room temperature
- 15ml pure vanilla extract
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- 130g all purpose flour*
- 100g good quality, unsweetened cocoa powder
- 200g roughly chopped chocolate or large chocolate chips

- cooking oil spray or butter for greasing the pan
- coco powder for dusting the pan

## Method ## 

1. Preheat oven to 175°C.
2. Lightly grease an 8x12-inch baking pan* with cooking oil spray or butter.
3. Line with parchment/baking paper, grease that.
4. Dust the pan with coco powder, set aside. 
3. Combine melted butter, oil and sugars together in a medium-sized bowl. Whisk well to combine. 
4. Add the eggs and vanilla.
5. Beat until lighter in colour (another minute).
6. Sift in flour, cocoa powder and salt. 
7. Gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until JUST combined (do NOT over beat as doing so well affect the texture of your brownies).
8. Fold in ¾ of the chocolate pieces.
9. Pour batter into prepared pan, smoothing the top out evenly, and top with remaining chocolate pieces.
10. Bake for 25-30 minutes.
11. Test for doneness, you can use any of these methods (or a combination):
    - The centre of the brownies in the pan no longer jiggles and is just set to the touch.
    - Using a toothpick, the toothpick should come out of the middle of the brownie dirty for fudge-textured brownies.
    - If you have an instant read thermometer, you can measure this more accurately:
        - Brownies should have an internal temperature between 74°C and 99°C.
        - 74°C will be fudgy, 99°C will be cakey.
        - For our brownies, about 90°C is ideal (even though this may sound too cakey)
11. These take quite a while to cool (~3 hours or so). Once they have, slice into 16 brownies and remove from the pan.

## Notes

- I've made this sucessfully using Dove gluten free plain flour.
    - It was a bit looser and fudgier than I think it should have been, next time I think I would go for ~150g flour.
- I used a 9"x9" metal pan, which worked well for this amount (89 inch² vs. 96 inch²).
- Cooking time, gluten free in the square pan 35 minutes worked nicely.
