# Shortbread # 

This was a BBC recipe, from [here](https://www.bbc.com/food/recipes/christmas_shortbread_76920).

## Ingredients ## 

- 150g caster sugar
- 300g softened butter
- 450g plain flour
- 75g chocolate chips

## Method ## 

1. Beat together the sugar and butter in a large bowl until pale and fluffy. 
2. Stir in half the flour until combined then add the remaining flour and use your hands to bring it together. 
3. Add your chosen fillings and use your hands to bring the dough into a rough ball.
4. Roll the dough into a fat sausage, roughly 5cm in diameter. Wrap tightly in cling film and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or until solid.
5. Preheat the oven to 180°C and line a baking tray with baking paper.
6. Unwrap the cling film and slice the sausage into ~24 rounds, roughly 2cm wide. 
7. Place onto the lined tray and cook for 15–20 minutes or until the edges are beginning to brown but the tops have no colour.
8. Leave to cool slightly and enjoy. 

These will keep well for at least 1 week in a sealed container, but the fresher they are the better.
