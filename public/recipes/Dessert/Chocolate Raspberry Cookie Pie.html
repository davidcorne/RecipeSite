# Chocolate Raspberry Cookie Pie #

Originally from [here](http://twistedfood.co.uk/chocolate-raspberry-cookie-pie/)
 
## Ingrediente

- 300g chocolate cookies, finely crushed
- 120g butter, melted
- 150g fresh raspberries
- 370ml coffee (cafetiere)
- 250g dark (70%+) chocolate
- 250g butter
- 2 eggs
- 95g muscavado sugar
- 95g caster sugar
- 30g cocoa powder
- ¼ tsp salt
- 185g self-raising flour

## Method

1. Mix your crushed cookies with the butter. Tip into a lined, loose-bottomed tin and press down and up the sides to form your pie crust. Freeze for 30 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, over a very low heat, melt your coffee, butter, sugars and chocolate until glossy and smooth (it should be warm, not hot). Leave to cool for a few minutes. Sieve your flour, cocoa and salt into a large bowl. Add your chocolate mix and eggs and whisk until smooth and gloopy.
3. Pour ½ of your mix into your pie crust. Add your raspberries in an even layer. Add the rest of your chocolate mix. Bake for 30 minutes at 180°C.
4. Leave to cool slightly before removing from the tin. Great warm with ice-cream!
