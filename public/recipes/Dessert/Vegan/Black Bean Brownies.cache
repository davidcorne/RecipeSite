Black Bean Brownies – No Flour Required!
Ingredients
1 1/2 cups black beans (1 15-oz can, drained and rinsed very well) (250g after draining)
2 tbsp cocoa powder (10g)
1/2 cup quick oats (40g) (See nutrition link below for substitutions)
1/4 tsp salt
1/3 cup pure maple syrup or agave (or honey, but not for strict vegans.) (75g)
pinch uncut stevia OR 2 tbsp sugar (or omit and increase maple syrup to 1/2 cup)
1/4 cup coconut or vegetable oil (40g) (See nutrition link for substitution notes)
2 tsp pure vanilla extract
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 cup to 2/3 cup chocolate chips (115-140g) (Not optional. Omit at your own risk.)
optional: more chips, for presentation
Total Time: 15m
Yield: 9-12 brownies
Instructions
Black Bean Brownies Recipe: Preheat oven to 350 F. Combine all ingredients except chips in
a good food processor, and blend until completely smooth. Really blend well. (A blender can
work if you absolutely must, but the texture—and even the taste—will be much better in a
food processor.) Stir in the chips, then pour into a greased 8×8 pan. Optional: sprinkle extra
chocolate chips over the top. Cook the black bean brownies 15-18 minutes, then let cool at
least 10 minutes before trying to cut. If they still look a bit undercooked, you can place them
in the fridge overnight and they will magically ᠀ꠄrm up! Makes 9-12 brownies. If you make this
recipe, don’t forget to leave a review! The trick with these: serve them ᠀ꠄrst, and then reveal
the secret ingredient. In all the times I’ve served bean desserts, not one single person who
didn’t know beforehand has ever guessed!
