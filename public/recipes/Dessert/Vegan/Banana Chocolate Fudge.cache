Healthy 4 Ingredient Banana Chocolate Chunky Monkey Fudge

2
Ingredients
2 overripe bananas, mashed
1 cup drippy cashew butter or peanut butter (can sub for another nut butter or nut free alternative)
1/4 cup coconut oil
1-2 T chocolate chips of choice (I used dairy free mini chips)
Instructions
Line a small 6 x 6 or 4 x 6 baking tray with parchment paper and set aside.
In a large mixing bowl, add your mashed bananas and set aside.
In a microwave safe bowl or stovetop, melt your coconut oil with your nut butter. Pour into the mixing bowl and mix well with your mashed
banana. Stir through your chocolate chips- It should start to melt and marble through.
Transfer the fudge batter into the lined baking tray and press Örmly in place. Place in the freezer for at least 30 minutes, to Örm up before
slicing into pieces.
Notes
Banana Chocolate chunky monkey fudge is best kept in the freezer, but for a softer texture, you can keep them refrigerated. Regardless of which
method you store them as, only thaw them out slightly- They lose their Örmness quite quickly.
