10 MINUTES PLUS CHILLING
SUPER EASY
Ingredients
200 g dairy-free dark chocolate (at
least 75% cocoa solids)
700 g silken tofu
160 g maple syrup
1 lime , zest of
1 tablespoon vanilla bean paste
1 tablespoon dark rum
1 large pinch of dried chilli Öakes
1 large pinch of sea salt
Method
1. Place a small pan over a medium-low heat, half-Õll with boiling
water, then place a medium heatproof bowl on top, making sure
the base doesn’t touch the surface of the water. Break in the
chocolate, then allow to melt, stirring occasionally.
2. Meanwhile, line a medium bowl with a clean tea towel. Add the
tofu, bunch up the tea towel and squeeze out the excess moisture
into the bowl.
3. Add the tofu to a food processor with the remaining ingredients
and 1 good pinch of sea salt, then blitz for 1 to 2 minutes, or until
smooth.
4. Add the melted chocolate and pulse until silky and combined.
5. Divide the mixture between little bowls (to make it extra special, I
like to use a mixture of espresso cups and cute little glasses).
6. Pop in the fridge for 15 minutes to chill, then serve.
Tips
Try serving your chocolate pots with shavings of dairy-free dark
chocolate, or bash up your favourite crunchy biscuits or nuts and
sprinkle them on top.
