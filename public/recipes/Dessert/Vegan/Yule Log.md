## Ingredients ## 

- 1 x 400g tin of chickpea worth of aquafaba
- 100g sugar
- 60g plain flour
- 40g cocoa powder
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 tbsp applesauce
- oil for greasing
- icing sugar for dusting

### Buttercream

- 250g icing sugar
- 30g cocoa powder
- 120g dairy-free margarine/butter

## Method ## 

1. Preheat the oven to 200°C and lightly grease a Swiss roll tin with oil. 
2. Line the tin with baking paper and grease the baking paper with oil to ensure the cake doesn’t stick.
3. Pour the aquafaba into a food processor and blend for roughly a minute until it turns white and fluffy. 
4. Add the sugar and process again until the aquafaba and sugar are fully combined.
5. Add the flour, cocoa powder, applesauce and vanilla extract to the food processor, and gently process until all the ingredients are fully combined.
6. Pour the cake mixture into the Swiss roll tray and tap gently against the tray until the mixture is level.
7. Bake the cake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes.
8. Remove the cake from the oven and run a knife around the edges.
9. Leave it to cool for 5 minutes.
10. Dust the top of the cake with icing sugar, this will ensure the cake doesn’t stick to itself when you roll it.
11. Line a chopping board with a tea towel and carefully invert the cake onto the tea towel.
12. Gently peel off the baking paper and dust the bottom of the cake with icing sugar.
13. Very slowly, start rolling the cake from one of the longer edges using the tea towel for friction. Make sure you roll the cake with the tea towel inside.
14. Leave the cake to cool completely.
15. Meanwhile, make the buttercream frosting by processing all the ingredients in a food processor or with a whisk until the cream is light and fluffy.
16. Once the cake has cooled, very carefully unroll it and put the tea towel to one side. Don’t worry if there are a few cracks because these will be covered by the buttercream frosting.
17. Using a knife or an offset spatula, place half of the buttercream frosting onto the cake and smooth it out. Leave a cm gap around the edges so the buttercream doesn’t spill out when you roll the cake.
18. Roll the cake back up again and transfer to your serving plate. Use the tea towel again if it makes it easier to move the cake.
19. To create a small branch, cut a one inch slice and position it against the yule log.
20. Cover the cake with the remaining buttercream frosting, then run a fork over the outside to create a bark-style pattern.
21. Dust with icing and serve.
