Mini Crunch Bars with Peanut Butter Shell Drizzle
By Angela Liddon
Like the store bought candy bar, only much tastier and better for you! This dark chocolate bar comes together in
about about 15 minutes Şat. Try serving it at a Halloween party, but make sure to keep the bars in the freezer
until just before serving. They will get soft at room temperature so you can try serving them on a chilled plate.
One thing is for sure, they won't last long!
Ingredients:
Crunch Bar
1/2 cup coconut oil
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
5 tablespoons liquid sweetener (maple syrup, agave, etc.), or to taste
pinch of *ne grain sea salt, to taste
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 cup rice crisp cereal
Peanut Butter Shell Drizzle
2 tablespoons all-natural peanut butter (or any nut/seed butter of choice)
1.5-2 teaspoons coconut oil, as needed to thin out
1 teaspoon liquid sweetener (maple syrup, agave, etc.)
Directions:
1. For the crunch bar: Line a 9x5 inch loaf pan with two pieces of parchment paper, one going each
way. In a pot over low heat, gently melt the coconut oil and then whisk in the rest of the crunch bar
ingredients (except the rice crisp) to taste. Once the mixture is smooth remove from heat and stir in
the rice crisp cereal. Pour mixture into prepared pan, smooth out, and then freeze for 10-15
minutes, or until the chocolate is solid.
2. For the PB drizzle: Melt the coconut oil and then whisk in the peanut butter and liquid sweetener.
Adjust to taste if desired. Scoop into a plastic baggie.
3. Remove crunch bar from freezer and cut into 12 small bars. Snip a tiny hole in the baggie and
drizzle the PB mixture onto the bar (you can also try drizzling it with a spoon, if desired).
4. Return bars to the freezer until the PB drizzle is solid, about 5 minutes.
5. Serve straight from the freezer or fridge. Bars will melt slightly at room temperature so I don't
suggest keeping them out long. Store leftovers in the fridge or freezer.
Tips:
Note: To make these bars nut-free, use sunŞower seed butter (I like Sunbutter brand) in place of the peanut
butter.
