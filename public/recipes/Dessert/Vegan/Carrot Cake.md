# Carrot Cake # 

This is from the [vegan society recipe](https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/recipes/gluten-free/carrot-and-walnut-cake-gluten-free).

## Ingredients ## 

### Cake
- vegan and gluten-free margarine, for greasing
- 225g (8 oz) gluten-free self-raising flour
- 2 tsp gluten-free baking powder
- 115g (4 oz) brown sugar
- 2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1 tsp ground nutmeg
- 85g (3 oz) walnuts, roughly chopped
- 225g (8 oz) carrots, grated
- 125ml (4 fl oz) maple syrup
- 125ml (4 fl oz) rapeseed oil

### Icing
- 115g (4 oz) vegan and gluten-free cream cheese
- 55g (2 oz) vegan and gluten-free margarine
- 225g (8 oz) vegan and gluten-free icing sugar

## Method ## 
1. Preheat the oven to 160°C/325°F/Gas Mark 3. Grease an 18-cm/7-inch round, loose-based cake tin and line with baking paper.
2. Sift the flour and baking powder into a large mixing bowl.
3. Stir in the sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and walnuts and mix well.
4. Stir the carrots into the dry ingredients, along with the maple syrup and rapeseed oil, and mix well.
5. Spoon the mixture into the prepared cake tin, smooth the top with a rubber spatula and bake for 1 hour, or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. Leave the cake in the tin to firm up for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack and allow to cool completely before frosting.
6. Make the frosting:
    1. Beat the cream cheese and margarine together until smooth and fluffy.
    2. Sift in the icing sugar while beating.
7. Spread the filling generously on the top of the cake, and on the sides too if you like. Leave to set before serving.
