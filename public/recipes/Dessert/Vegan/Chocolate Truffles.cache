OF AN ADULT'S REFERENCE INTAKE
NUTRITION PER SERVING
Ingredients
300 g dairy-free dark chocolate
3 tablespoons coconut oil
240 ml light coconut milk
1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste , or
vanilla extract
1 handful of desiccated coconut
1 handful of mixed nuts , such as
pecans, hazelnuts and macadamias
2 tablespoons cocoa powder
Method
Chop the chocolate into small pieces, then place into a bowl with the
coconut oil. Heat the coconut milk in a small pan over a low heat,
then pour into the bowl and stir gently to combine – it’s important
not to mix too quickly. 
Stir in the vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract. Cover the bowl with
cling Õlm, then place in the fridge to set for at least 4 hours. 
When the truØe mixture has almost set, toast the desiccated coconut
over a medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes, or until lightly golden. Tip
onto a plate, then return the pan to a medium heat and add the nuts.
Toast for around 2 minutes, or until golden, then leave to cool for a
few minutes. Finely chop, then place onto a second plate. Spread out
the cocoa powder onto a third plate. 
Using a teaspoon, scoop out little balls of the truØe mixture and roll
in the palm of your hands, placing them onto a tray as you go. It’s
totally up to you how you decorate them – roll the balls in either the
toasted coconut or chopped nuts, or for a simple Õnish, roll them in
the cocoa powder. Return the decorated truØes to the fridge for
around 10 minutes to Õrm up, then serve.
