# Pavlova # 

This based on the pavlova [here](https://thehappyfoodie.co.uk/recipes/vegan-pavlova-meringue-tower) but made as a black forest version.

## Ingredients ## 

- aquafaba from 2 x 400g tin of chickpeas
- 250g caster sugar
- 500g black forest fruits (frozen works very well here)
- 2 x 400ml tins of full fat coconut milk
- ~200g chocolate chips (I didn't 100% measure this)
- 1 tbsp coconut oil
- A few squares of chocolate, peeled into curls

## Method ## 

### Meringues 

1. Preheat the oven to 110°C.
2. In a clean bowl, whisk the chickpea liquid for 10 minutes, using an electric whisk. It will become thick, stiff and creamy, with soft peaks.
3. Sprinkle in the caster sugar and keep whisking, adding the sugar into the mixture for a further 5 minutes.
4. Get out two baking trays. Draw a 23cm circle on a sheet of baking parchment. Draw a second circle beside it. You should be able to draw two circles on each baking tray. Altogether you’ll draw four circles.
5. Spoon the meringue mix to fill your marked circles, then put the two baking trays into the preheated oven for 2½ hours.
6. When they are ready, take them out, leave to cool for 40 minutes, and carefully peel off the baking parchment.

### Filling

1. Skim the cream from the top of each tin of coconut milk. Put into a bowl and add the vanilla extract and 2 tablespoons of the clear coconut milk from the cans. 
2. Whisk with an electric whisk for 1 minute to bring it all together and remove any lumps. Set this aside.
3. Heat the chocolate and coconut oil using a double boiler.
4. When it's melted, pour slightly less than half on the meringue you will use for the base layer, and spread it around. Then return it to the double boiler.
5. Once this has set, top with the whipped coconut cream, and half the fruit.
6. Carefully lay the top meringue onto the base.
7. Spread the remaining chocolate onto the top, you can pool it by the edges to get a more drip cake effect.
8. While the chocolate is still soft arrange the remaining fruit on top, and sprinkle with the chocolate curls.
