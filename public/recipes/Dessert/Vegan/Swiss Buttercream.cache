Swiss Buttercream
# Swiss Buttercream # 

This is a vegan swiss buttercream recipe from Gretchen's Bakery, [here](https://www.gretchensbakery.com/aquafaba-swiss-buttercream-recipe/).

## Ingredients ##

- 2 x 400g Cans of Chickpeas (for the water)
- 225g Granulated Sugar
- 2 tsps Vanilla Extract 
- 125g Icing Sugar
- Â½ tsp Cream of Tartar 
- 340g Vegan Butter
- 225g High Ratio Solid Vegetable shortening

## Method ## 
1. Combine the sugar with the chickpea water in a saucepan and bring to a full boil.
2. Boil for 5 minutes then transfer to a mixer bowl to cool completely.
3. With the whip attachment of the kitchen aid (a hand beater will work but it will take a very long time) whip the aquafaba on high speed until it is thick and glossy and has firm peaks.
4. Combine the cream of tartar with 2 tbs of icing sugar and then add that to the whipped, firm peaked meringue.
5. Continue whipping and add the remaining icing sugar.
5. Add the shortening and softened vegan butter and continue whipping on high speed to a smooth emulsion.
6. Add vanilla last

## Notes
Vegan Buttercream is softer than regular buttercream so it is helpful to store it and any cakes, pastries made with it, in the refrigerator ((for up to 2 weeks)), then bring the leftovers to room temperature before using by re-whipping it back to workable consistency.
