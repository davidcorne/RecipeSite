# Fudge Topping # 

This is from [here](https://lovingitvegan.com/dairy-free-fudge/), we often use it to top our [ginger flapjacks](/public/recipes/Dessert/Ginger%20Flapjack.pdf).

## Ingredients ## 

- 120ml Soy Milk
- 250g White Sugar
- 56g Vegan Butter (Softened)
- 155g Vegan Chocolate or Chocolate Chips*
- 1 tsp Vanilla Extract

## Method ## 

1. Line a loaf pan with parchment paper and set aside.
2. Prepare your vegan butter and break up your chocolate and have your vanilla extract on a teaspoon ready to go in. Everything must be prepared before you start as it will all happen very quickly.
3. Add the soy milk and sugar to a saucepan and heat, stirring continuously until boiling.
4. Set a timer and once boiling let it boil, while stirring constantly, for exactly 7-minutes.
5. Remove from heat and add the vegan butter, chocolate and vanilla and stir in vigorously.
6. Working quickly as it will start setting very fast, transfer to the parchment lined loaf pan and smooth down with the back of a spoon.
7. Place into the refrigerator to set.
8. Once set, lift out the entire block of fudge by lifting out the parchment paper, cut into squares and enjoy.

## Notes
* Fudge can be a tricky beast, even though this recipe is easy, working with boiling sugar is always a bit of a thing.
* I would recommend not substituting ingredients here as these are the ones that have been tested and I have not tried this recipe with variations of ingredients.
