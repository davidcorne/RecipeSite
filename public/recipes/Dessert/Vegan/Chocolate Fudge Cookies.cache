No-Bake Chocolate Fudge Cookies
By Angela Liddon
These no-bake fudge cookies are my quick and easy solution when a chocolate craving strikes! I start with a
homemade coconut oil chocolate base (made even creamier with sun᯿贄ower seed butter!), and add chia seeds
for healthy Omega-3 fats, shredded coconut for a hint of macaroon ᯿贄avor and texture, and of course rolled oats
for the classic no-bake cookie ingredient. The cookies will soften a great deal at room temperature, so I
recommend enjoying them straight from the fridge.
Ingredients:
For the wet ingredients:
3 tablespoons (45 mL) virgin coconut oil
2 tablespoons (30 mL) sun᯿贄ower seed butter*
1/4 cup (20 g) unsweetened cocoa powder
1/4 cup (60 mL) pure maple syrup, or to taste
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
For the dry ingredients:
7 tablespoons (50 g) gluten-free rolled oats
6 tablespoons (35 g) unsweetened shredded coconut
2 tablespoons (25 g) chia seeds
1/8 teaspoon ᯿贄ne sea salt, or to taste
Directions:
1. Line a large plate with parchment paper and set aside.
2. In a medium pot, melt the coconut oil over low heat. Whisk in the sun᯿贄ower seed butter, cocoa
powder, and maple syrup until smooth. Remove the pot from the heat and whisk in the vanilla.
3. Add the oats, coconut, chia seeds, and salt into the pot and stir well until combined. The mixture will
be thick, dense, oily, and gel-like (from the chia seeds), but this is normal. Swear.
4. Using a retractable ice cream scoop (approximately 2 tablespoons/30 mL) or simply a spoon, scoop
the dough and place the mound onto the plate, leaving a bit of space between each cookie.
5. Place the cookies in the freezer to set for about 10 to 15 minutes, until ᯿贄rm, or simply chill in the
fridge if you have the patience.
6. Store leftover cookies in an airtight container in the fridge for 1 week, or freeze them for up to 4 to 6
weeks. These cookies have the best texture/᯿贄avour straight from the fridge (rather than the freezer)
so I prefer to store them in the fridge.
Tips:
* Instead of sun᯿贄ower seed butter, feel free to use natural peanut butter or almond butter. I also
recommend stirring the nut or seed butter very well before measuring (if it has oil on the top) to avoid
oily cookies.
