Want to eat churros every morning but don't want to deal with daily deep frying? Then
these waćed churros are for you. Plus, the nooks and crannies of the waćed churros
provide space for the chocolate sauce to pool.
Why this recipe works:
Note: Any leftover cinnamon sugar can be saved and added to coĂee or hot chocolate.

1.For the Batter: In a small saucepan, bring water, butter, salt, sugar,
and cinnamon to a simmer over high heat.
2.When butter has melted and sugar and salt have dissolved, lower
heat to medium, add ąour, and stir rapidly. The batter will form
quickly as the ąour absorbs the water mixture. Continue to cook
over medium heat, stirring, for 1 minute.
3.Remove saucepan from heat and allow mixture to stand for 5
minutes. Add eggs one at a time to batter mixture, stirring until
each is incorporated. The batter will be very stiĂ and look a bit like
buttercream frosting.
4.Meanwhile, For the Topping and Chocolate Sauce: Mix sugar and
cinnamon on a plate for dipping. In a saucepan over low heat,
combine cream, chocolate, and corn syrup and stir frequently until
chocolate begins to melt. Turn oĂ heat and set chocolate mixture
aside.
5.Preheat the waće iron. (Set it to medium if it has temperature
settings.) Coat both sides of the waće iron with nonstick cooking
spray.
6.Place about 1/4 cup of batter on each section of waće iron. Do
not overstuĂ waće iron—the batter will expand considerably. (Err
on the side of using less batter before you see how much it
Using a waće iron instead of deep-frying produces churros without the hassle of
heating up a pot of oil on the stovetop.
