## The Lone Baker's Chocolate Soil

## Ingredients ## 
- 100g Caster Sugar
- 75g Dark Chocolate roughly chopped (even if you don't usually like 70% dark chocolate, I would recommend using it here because your are adding sugar to counteract the bitterness)

## Method ## 

0. Cover a baking tray with non-stick paper to cool this later.
1. On you stove top in a small to medium saucepan add the caster sugar, gently pour in 2 tablespoons of cold water. We are being gentle so we don't splash sugar crystals on the side of the pan.
2. Turn on your heat to high and you are going to just let it do it's thing without stirring, the sugar will dissolve and bubble and boil until you see "golden brown edges". 
3. The center of the boiling sugar is still clear, the edges have changed to golden brown. 
4. Have your roughly chopped chocolate ready to go.
5. Immediately remove saucepan from the heat and all at once whisk in the chocolate, along with any flavouring if using. Don't forget to whisk around the edges. Whisk until all the chocolate is coated, this doesn't take long ... a couple of minutes.
6. it starts to look like "soil" almost instantly.
7. It's finished and ready to poured onto your prepared baking tray to cool.
8. Once cool, store in an airtight container for up to a week, or freeze up to a month.
