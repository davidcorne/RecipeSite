# Bitter Orange Sauce # 

This is a bitter orange sauce from The Professional Pastry Chef, found from ckbk [here](https://app.ckbk.com/recipe/prof59258c16s006r028/orange-sauce#login) and [here](https://app.ckbk.com/recipe/prof59258c16s006ss003r001/bitter-orange-sauce).

When refrigerated overnight, this sauce will set to a jellylike consistency. The gelling occurs because of the large amount of natural pectin present in oranges. Forcing the sauce through a fine mesh strainer is usually all that is needed to make it smooth again but, if necessary, reheat to thin it out.

## Ingredients ## 

- 960 ml strained fresh orange juice (from 10 to 12 oranges)
- 5 tablespoons (40g) cornstarch
- 2 tablespoons (30ml) lemon juice
- 170g granulated sugar

## Method ## 

### Orange Sauce

1. Add enough orange juice to the 40g of cornstarch to make a liquid slurry.
1. Stir this into the remaining 960ml of orange juice.
1. Add the 30ml of lemon juice and 170g of sugar, adjusting the taste by adding more or less sugar as needed, depending on the sweetness of the orange juice.
1. Heat to boiling in a stainless-steel or other noncorrosive pan.
