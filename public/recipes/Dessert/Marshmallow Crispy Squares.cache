# Marshmallow Crispy Squares # 

This is a lovely simple recipe from [Nigella](https://www.nigella.com/recipes/marshmallow-crispy-squares). I've replicated it with â…” of the ingredients to the original recipe, as supermarkets tend to have 200g bags of marshmallows.

## Ingredients ## 

- 30g butter
- 200g marshmallows
- 120g rice krispies

## Method ## 

1. Line a 9 x 9 inch pan with cling-film, if you use a long piece you'll be able to wrap it around and use it to flatten the squares.
1. Melt the butter in a large, heavy-based saucepan over a low heat.
1. Add the marshmallows and cook gently until they are completely melted and blended, stirring constantly.
1. Take the pan off the heat and immediately add the cereal, mixing lightly until well coated.
1. Cover the crispy squares with cling-film.
1. Flatten the top and press down the sides, so it's an even thickness.
1. Let the marshmallow crispy squares cool completely in the tin (in or out of the fridge) and then cut them into squares.
