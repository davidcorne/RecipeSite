Raspberry Bakewell cake
Method
Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and base-line and grease a
deep 20cm loose-bottomed cake tin. Blitz the ground almonds,
butter, sugar, flour, eggs and vanilla extract in a food processor until
well combined.
Spread half the mix over the cake tin and smooth over the top.
Scatter the raspberries over, then dollop the remaining cake mixture
on top and roughly spread â€“ you might find this easier to do with
your fingers. Scatter with flaked almonds and bake for 50 mins until
golden. Cool, remove from the tin and dust with icing sugar to serve.
