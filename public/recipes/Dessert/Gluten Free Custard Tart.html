# Gluten Free Custard Tart # 

This is a [Dove's Farm](https://www.dovesfarm.co.uk/recipes/custard-tart) recipe, which works well. I've made it sucessfully with the recommended Dove Farms FREEE plain flour, and using oat milk.

## Ingredients ## 

### Pastry

- 100g gluten free plain white flour
- 2 tbsp icing sugar
- ¼ tsp xanthan gum
- 50g butter
- 1 egg
- 1-2 tbsp cold water
- butter, for tin
- flour, for dusting

### Custard Filling

- 3 egg yolks
- 50g sugar
- 250ml milk
- pinch of nutmeg

## Method ## 

### Sweet Pastry

1. Pre-heat the oven to 160°C (fan).
1. Rub a little butter around the insides of 20cm/8” tart tin.
1. Sieve the flour, sugar and xanthan gum into a bowl and stir to combine and sieve it into a mixing bowl.
1. Add the butter and using a fork or pastry blender, work them together until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.
1. Add the egg and stir, adding enough of the water to bring the pastry easily together into a soft, slightly sticky dough.
1. Using your hands, gather everything together to form a ball of pastry dough.
1. Dust the work surface with flour, put the pastry in the middle and sprinkle it with more flour.
1. Roll the pastry out to a circle 5cm/2” larger than your dish and lift it into the dish OR simply press the dough into the dish using your fingers.
1. Cut away any pastry that hangs over the edge of the dish and prick the pastry all over with a fork.

### Blind Baking

1. Lay a large piece of parchment over the raw pastry, making sure all the edges are covered.
1. Scatter ceramic baking beans (or rice or flour) over the parchment, spreading them all over the surface.
1. Bake for 12-15 minutes.
1. Remove from the oven and carefully lift the parchment and contents off the pastry.
1. Return the pastry to the oven and cook for a further 10-12 minutes without browning too much.
1. Take the dish out of the oven and leave to cool.

### Custard Filling

1. Put the egg yolks and sugar into a mixing bowl and whisk together.
1. Measure the milk into a saucepan and bring it to the boil.
1. Slowly pour the hot milk into the bowl while whisking.
1. Return everything to the saucepan and bring gently back to the boil.
1. Pour the mixture into the prepared pastry case.
1. Sprinkle grated nutmeg over the top.
1. Bake for 20-25 minutes, the filling may be wobbly.
1. Leave to cool and chill before serving.
