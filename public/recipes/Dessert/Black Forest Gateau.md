## Ingredients ##

- 175g salted butter, plus extra for the tin
- 200g dark chocolate
- 300g plain flour
- 375g golden caster sugar
- 25g cocoa
- 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
- 2 eggs
- 200g buttermilk or natural yogurt

### To assemble

- 425g can pitted cherries, drained with 2 tbsp juice reserved
- 100g morello cherry jam
- 4 tbsp kirsch (or more juice from the can if you want it to be non-alcoholic)
- 500ml double cream
- 3 tbsp icing sugar
- 1 small punnet fresh cherries (optional)

## Method ##

1. Heat oven to 180°C/160°C fan.
1. Grease and line the base of 3 x 20cm cake tins.
1. Boil the kettle.
1. Put the 175g butter and 75g chocolate broken into chunks in a small pan and gently heat, stirring, until completely melted.
1. Mix together the 300g flour, 375g sugar, 25g cocoa and 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda with a pinch of salt in a mixing bowl.
1. Whisk the 2 eggs and 200g buttermilk or yogurt together.
1. Scrape the melted chocolate mixture and egg mixture into the dry ingredients, add 100ml boiling water and whizz briefly with an electric whisk until the cake batter is lump free.
1. Divide the mixture between the tins and bake for 25 mins, swapping the tins round after 20 mins if they’re on different shelves. To test they're done, push in a skewer and check that it comes out clean.
1. Prick the cakes a few times with a skewer.
1. Mix together the 2 tbsp reserved cherry juice and the 4 tbsp kirsch (or more juice) and drizzle over the cakes.
1. Cool the cakes.

### Assembly

1. Mix together the drained cherries and 100g jam.
1. Tip 200ml of the cream into a small pan and heat until just below simmering point.
1. Chop the remaining chocolate and put in a heatproof bowl, pour over the hot cream and stir until melted. Set aside until spreadable.
1. When the cakes are cool whisk the remaining 300ml cream and the 3 tbsp icing sugar together until softly whipped.
1. Spread over two of the cakes, then spoon over the jammy cherries.
1. Stack the cakes together.
1. Spread the chocolate cream over the third cake and sit on top of the other cakes.
1. Pile the fresh cherries in and around the cake and serve.

## Notes

- I made this with Dove's farm gluten free plain flour and it worked very well.
- I also made this with a mixture of fresh blackberries and frozen black forest gateau fruit mix.
