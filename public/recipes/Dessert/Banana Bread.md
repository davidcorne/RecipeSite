# Brilliant Banana Loaf #

This is a [BBC Good Food](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/brilliant-banana-loaf) recipe, we've used it a lot and it adapts to gluten free really well.

## Ingredients ##

- 140g butter, softened, plus extra for the tin
- 140g caster sugar
- 2 large eggs, beaten
- 140g self-raising flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 2 very ripe bananas, mashed
- 50g icing sugar
- handful dried banana chips, for decoration

## Method ##

1. Heat oven to 180°C/160°C fan/gas 4.
1. Butter a 2lb loaf tin and line the base and sides with baking parchment.
1. Cream 140g softened butter and 140g caster sugar until light and fluffy, then slowly add 2 beaten large eggs with a little of the 140g flour.
1. Fold in the remaining flour, 1 tsp baking powder and 2 mashed bananas.
1. Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and bake for about 50 mins, or until cooked through. Check the loaf at 5-min intervals from around 30-40 mins in the oven by testing it with a skewer (it should be able to be inserted and removed cleanly), as the time may vary depending on the shape of your loaf tin.
1. Cool in the tin for 10 mins, then remove to a wire rack .
1. Mix 50g icing sugar with 2-3 tsp water to make a runny icing.
1. Drizzle the icing across the top of the cake and decorate with a handful of banana chips.

## Notes

- This works really well gluten free, we tend to use Dove Farms self-raising flour.
- This also works well with chocolate chips in it, use a small handful.
