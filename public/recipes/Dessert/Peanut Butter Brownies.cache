Peanut butter brownies
Method
Set aside 50g each of the peanut butter and chocolate. Heat
oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line a 20cm square baking tin
with baking parchment. Gently melt remaining peanut butter,
chocolate and all the sugar in a pan, stirring occasionally, until the
sugar has just about melted. Turn off heat and use a wooden spoon
to beat in the eggs one by one. Stir in the flour and scrape into the
tin.
Melt reserved peanut butter in the microwave on High for 45
secs, or in a pan, until runny, then drizzle over the brownie. Bake for
30-35 mins until it has a crust, but the middle still seems slightly
uncooked.
Melt reserved chocolate, drizzle over the brownie, then cool in
the tin before cutting into squares.
Ingredients
225g crunchy peanut butter
200g bar dark chocolate, broken
into pieces
280g soft light brown sugar
3 medium eggs
100g self-raising flour
