# White Chocolate-Grand Marnier Mousse # 

## Ingredients ## 

- 4 large egg yolks
- ¼ cup Grand Marnier
- 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon grated orange zest
- 250ml double cream, whipped
- 930g white chocolate, melted

__Chocolate-Pistachio Tuile Cups:__

- 2 large egg whites
- 4 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons granulated sugar
- 5 tablespoons butter, melted
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 5 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon cocoa powder
- 4 teaspoons crushed pistachios

## Method ## 

1. In a stainless steel bowl set over a saucepan of boiling water, combine the egg yolks, Grand Marnier, sugar, and orange zest, and whisk to incorporate.
2. Whisking constantly and removing from the heat from time to time, cook until the mixture has thickened and coats the back of a spoon into a sabayon, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool.
2. Fold the whipped cream into the cooled sabayon, then fold in the melted chocolate. 
4. Refrigerate until well chilled, at least 6 hours. Transfer to a pastry bag fitted with a star tip.
3. To serve, place 1 tuile cup in the center of 8 dessert plates. Pipe (or alternately spoon) ¼ cup of the mousse into the cups and garnish with the mint sprigs and powdered sugar.

__Chocolate-Pistachio Tuile Cups:__

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside. Invert 8 shot glasses or tea cups on the counter.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg whites, sugar, and pistachios until just combined. Add the butter and vanilla, and whisk. Add the flour and cocoa powder, and whisk. 
3. Drop the batter by 1½ tablespoonfuls onto the baking sheet, about 4 inches apart. Using a small spatula or the back of a spoon, spread the batter out to form a thin 4½ -inch circle (the batter needs to be a thin, even coat because the cookies will not spread when cooked). 
4. Bake for 12 to 13 minutes, or until a deep brown. Remove from the oven. 
5. With a thin spatula, quickly remove the cookies 1 at a time from the baking sheet and drape on top of a ramekin to create a cup shape. (If the cookies become too brittle, replace on the baking sheet and place in the oven for 10 seconds to soften.) 
6. Cool completely on the glasses, then gently lift off and transfer to a platter until ready to use.
