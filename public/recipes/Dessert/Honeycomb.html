# Honeycomb # 

This is a recipe from Adam Byatt, found [here](https://www.greatbritishchefs.com/recipes/honeycomb-recipe) on the Great British Chefs website. I've modified it as liquid glucose come in 140ml tubes in my local supermarket, so this has 70% ingredients and uses a smaller pan.

## Ingredients ## 

- 140g caster sugar
- 42g golden syrup
- 140ml glucose syrup
- 14g bicarbonate of soda

## Method ## 

1. Line a deep 23cm diameter baking tray with parchment paper
2. Add the 200g of caster sugar, 60g of golden syrup and 200ml of glucose syrup to a large, flat pan.
3. Place the pan over a medium heat and heat gently to a light golden-brown caramel.
4. The temperature should reach 165°C on a sugar thermometer; if you don’t have a thermometer, heat the mix to a straw colour and immediately move to the next step
5. Sprinkle the 20g bicarbonate of soda over the caramel and stir through. Be very careful at this point as the caramel will be bubbling and hot
6. Pour the honeycomb onto the lined tray and place in the fridge.
7. Leave to cool for approximately 20 minutes, or until it has set firm
8. Break up the honeycomb into pieces, or grind into a powder using a food processor. Store in an airtight container in the freezer for up to a month
