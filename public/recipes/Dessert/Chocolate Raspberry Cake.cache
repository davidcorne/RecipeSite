Rich chocolate paired with raspberries - this chocolate cake is moist and fudgy. For a special treat, garnish with
fresh raspberries!
Ingredients
Serves: 12
170g plain chocolate
170g baking chocolate
7 eggs, separated
125g plain ‱੪our
225g butter
400g caster sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
170g plain chocolate
180ml whipping cream
100g frozen raspberries, thawed
3 tablespoons raspberry preserves
Preparation method
Prep: 1 hour |Cook: 45 min
1.Preheat oven to 150 C / Gas 2. Line bottoms of two 23cm sandwich tins with baking parchment.
 
2.To make cake: Melt 170g of plain chocolate and 170g of baking chocolate in the top of a double boiler, or in
a microwave. Cool, and beat in egg yolks.
 
3.In a large bowl, beat butter, 300g of the sugar and vanilla until light and ‱੪u‵㤶y. Add chocolate mixture, and
continue beating until smooth. Stir in ‱੪our until just combined.
 
4.In another bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. Gradually beat in remaining 100g sugar, and continue beating
until the whites hold soft peaks. Fold whites into chocolate mixture, in three additions. Pour cake mixture
into prepared cake tins, and smooth tops.
 
5.Bake until a skewer stuck into the centres of the cakes comes out with moist crumbs, about 45 minutes.
Cool in tins.
 
6.To make icing: In a saucepan, bring cream just to the boil. Chop 170g plain chocolate, and stir into the
cream. Remove saucepan from heat, and continue stirring until smooth. Pour icing into bowl, and press
sheet of cling 吠㸳lm directly against surface of chocolate to prevent formation of a skin. Refrigerate until thick
enough to spread.
 
7.To make 吠㸳lling: Drain the thawed raspberries, if necessary, and combine with the jam. Sandwich the cake
layers with raspberry 吠㸳lling. Spread top and sides with chocolate icing.
