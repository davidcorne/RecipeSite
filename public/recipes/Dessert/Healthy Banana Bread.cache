# Healthy Banana Bread # 

This is a sugar light and oil free banana bread recipe from [here](https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/skinny-banana-bread/#recipe).
    
    
## Ingredients ## 
    
- 4 bananas, about 1⅓ cups, mashed
- 1 large egg
- 1 Tablespoon vanilla extract
- 3 Tablespoons light brown sugar
- 2 Tablespoons granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 190g all-purpose flour (white or white-whole wheat)
- 30g unsalted butter, melted (or substitute applesauce)

## Method ## 

1. Grease a standard 9×5” loaf pan (I also like to line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper to make sure the loaf doesn’t stick).
1. Mash bananas in a mixing bowl.
1. Add egg, vanilla, brown sugar, granulated sugar, and cinnamon and stir well to combine.  
1. In a separate small bowl stir together flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Add to banana mixture and stir to combine. 
1. Gently stir in melted butter. Bake at 175°C. for 35-45 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. 
1. Allow to cool in the pan for 5-10 few minutes before inverting onto a wire cooling rack.

## Note ## 

- I've only made this gluten-free, it worked well replacing the flour with Dove's Farm plain flour.
