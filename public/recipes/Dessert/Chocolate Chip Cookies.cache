Chocolate Chip Cookies
# Chocolate Chip Cookies # 

These are designed to be frozen, but can easily be cooked straight away. This is based on [this recipe](http://allrecipes.co.uk/recipe/12570/freezer-friendly-chocolate-chip-cookies.aspx) with modifications based on the science in the [ATK Perfect Chocolate Chip Cookies](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/4737-perfect-chocolate-chip-cookies).

## Ingredients ## 

- 200g butter
- 220g caster sugar
- 150g dark brown soft sugar
- 2 eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda
- 375g plain flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 250g chocolate chips
- 200g white chocolate

## Method ## 

1. As prep, roughly chop the white chocolate. This will lead to slightly uneven shards of chocolate, but that means it will be encorporated well and taste great.
2. Melt the butter, and lightly brown it. This will develop a more rounded caramelly flavour.
3. Mix the sugars into the butter, then wait for 5-10 minutes. This will allow the suger to better disolve/melt into the butter and for the whole mixture to cool.
4. Encorporate the eggs one at a time into the mixture.
5. Add the vanilla extract.
6. Slowly add in the flour.
7. Add the chocolate chips and chopped white chocolate.
8. Form into tablespoon sized balls.
9. These can now be frozen. They should be placed on a baking sheet in the freezer for at least an hour, after than placed in a sealed container or plastic bag.
### Baking

1. Preheat oven to 200 C.
2. Place balls on greased baking tray, ensure they have enough room to spread.
2. Cook for 10-15 minutes from the freezer (8-10 if not frozen) until golden brown.
