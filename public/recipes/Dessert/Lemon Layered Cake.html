# Lemon Layered Cake # 

This is a pretty involved recipe from [here](https://www.sweetandsavorybyshinee.com/lemon-layer-cake-with-lemon-swiss-meringue-buttercream/), it took me about 3 hours total to make.

## Ingredients ## 

### Lemon sponge cake
- 6 large eggs, at room temperature
- 200g granulated sugar, 
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon lemon zest
- ½ teaspoon cream of tartar, optional
- 180g plain flour
- ½ teaspoon salt

### Lemon Swiss Buttercream
- 6 egg whites
- 300g granulated sugar
- 3 tablespoons lemon juice
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt
- 340g unsalted butter, softened and cubed

### Lemon Simple Syrup
- 150g granulated sugar
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice

### Lemon Curd
- 1 cup lemon curd

## Method ## 

### Cake

1. Preheat the oven to 180°C.
2. Line bottom of 1 9-inch springform pan (at least 3 inches tall) with parchment paper. You can also use 3 tier pans, but adjust the cooking time to 25-30 minutes.
3. Separate egg whites and yolks, making sure not even a little bit of egg yolk gets into the whites. (Tip: It’s easier to separate the egg when they’re cold right out of the fridge.)
4. In a mixing bowl with whisk attachment, whisk together egg yolks, half of the sugar, lemon juice and lemon zest until pale and tripled in volume, about 5 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, sift flour and salt.
6. In another mixing bowl with whisk attachment, beat egg whites at medium low speed until foamy.
7. Stir in cream of tartar, if using.
8. Add remaining half of the sugar 1 tablespoon at a time and continue to whisk until stiff peaks, gradually increasing the speed to medium high, 7-10 minutes.
9. Using a spatula, add a third of the whipped egg whites into the egg yolk mixture and gently fold until mostly smooth. 
10. Add the remaining egg whites and gently fold until smooth.
11. Add sifted flour into the batter in 3 stages, whisking the batter well after each addition.
12. Pour the batter into prepared pan and smooth the top.
13. Bake the cake until inserted toothpick comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Don’t open the oven for at least the first 30 minutes!
14. Let the cake cool for 5 minutes in the pan. 
15. Run a knife around the edges and invert onto a cooling rack. Cool completely. Once cooled, wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate, preferably overnight. It’ll be easier to slice it when the cake is thoroughly chilled.

## Swiss Meringue Buttercream

1. In a small saucepan, whisk together egg whites, sugar and lemon juice.
2. Cook the mixture until sugar melts and it reaches 70°C stirring continuously, about 5 minutes.
3. Transfer the mixture into clean, fat-free mixing bowl with a whisk attachment. Whisk on low speed for a minute, then slowly increase the speed to medium high and beat until stiff peaks form and the mixture is cool to touch, about 10 minutes.
4. Switch to a paddle attachment.
5. Slowly add butter one cube at a time. Make sure the butter is fully incorporated before adding the next one. The mixture might curdle, but don’t panic. Continue to beat the mixture until smooth, 5-10 minutes. (When the icing reaches the right consistency, you will start hearing slapping sound.)
6. Transfer the buttercream into a large frosting bag. You can use a round piping tip, if you have it, but it’s not necessary.

### Lemon Simple Syrup
1. In a small saucepan, combine 1 cup water, sugar and lemon juice. 
2. Bring it to a boil and simmer until sugar is fully dissolved. 
3. Remove from heat and cool completely.

### Assembly
1. Slice the cake into 3 even layers. (unless you've made it in 3 pans)
2. Place the bottom cake layer on a serving platter. (TIP: Place 3 strips of parchment or wax paper on the bottom to keep the serving platter clean.) 
3. Brush on a third of the chilled lemon syrup evenly on the cake.
4. Pipe the buttercream around the edges, creating a border.
5. Fill the inside with ⅓ cup of lemon curd. 
6. Pipe some buttercream over the curd and spread evenly with an offset spatula. 
7. Place the next cake layer and repeat.
8. Place the top cake layer upside down so that the top of the cake is nice and flat.
9. Coat the entire cake with frosting and smooth it with an offset spatula.
10. Decorate the cake with the remaining lemon curd, lemon slices and/or lemon macarons.
