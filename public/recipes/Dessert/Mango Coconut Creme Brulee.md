# Mango Coconut Creme Brulee # 

This is an interesting vegan recipe I saw on an [instagram reel](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CoXl_yEraBc/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link).

## Ingredients ## 

### Custard

- 300ml mango pulp, preferably from Kesar or Alphonso mangoes for best results
- 400ml coconut milk
- 1tsp vanilla paste
- 25g sugar
- 40g cornflour, this is corn starch in the US
- 1tbsp vegan butter
- 1-3 tbsp rose water (optional)

### Crust

- 4tbsp white sugar

## Method ## 

1. Whisk together the mango pulp, coconut milk, rose water (optional), vanilla, sugar, and cornflour in a saucepan before placing on the heat. Ensure no lumps of cornflour remain
1. Then place on a medium-high heat and stir continuously. Switch between a spatula and a whisk to ensure no lumps
1. Once thickened, take off the heat and add the butter.
1. Mix to incorporate, the mixture should coat the back of the spatula.
1. Transfer equally between ramekins and place immediately in the fridge to set for a min of 5hrs.
1. Shortly before serving, caramelise the sugar over a medium-low heat until smooth and just going brown. Transfer to baking paper to cool completely.
1. Grind the cooled shards into coarse granules.
1. Spoon equally on top of the set custard, then heat with a blow torch or place under the grill.
1. Allow the layer to set for several minutes before serving.
1. Must be served immediately or the sugar crust will soften.

## Notes

The rosewater is 3 tbsps in the original recipe, we found that a bit overpowering so I've made it an optional 1-3 tbsps in this.
