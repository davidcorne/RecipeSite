# Sticky Toffee Cake # 

This is a [Jane's Patisserie](https://www.janespatisserie.com/2020/06/06/sticky-toffee-cake/) recipe. It has worked well using Dove's Farm self-raising gluten free flour. I made more toffee sauce, as I needed to use up some cream and so made more buttercream too. This version reflects that change.

- 1.5 tbsp black treacle

## Method ## 

1. Preheat your oven to 180°C/160°C Fan
1. Line two 8"/20cm round cake tins with parchment paper.
1. De-stone your 180g of medjool dates, and chop up into quarters.
1. Add them to a bowl, along with the 1.5 tsp bicarbonate of soda and the 180 ml boiling water and leave to sit for 10 minutes. Once sat, blitz the mixture into a puree with a food processor, or blender until smooth!
1. Add your 125g unsalted butter to a bowl, along with the 225g dark brown sugar and beat until combined and smooth!
1. Add the 4 eggs into the mixture one at a time, and beat in each time.
1. Add in the 250g flour, 125g treacle, 1.5 tsp vanilla and pureed date mixture and beat again until smooth!
1. Pour the mixture into the tin, and bake the cake in the oven for 35-40 minutes, or until baked through! I test with a skewer, and listen for the cake to make no sounds!
1. Once baked, leave the cake to cool for 10 minutes in the tin, and then leave to cool fully on a wire rack.

### For the Sauce

1. Whilst the cake is baking... make the sauce!
1. Add all the ingredients (225 ml double cream, 1.5 tbsp black treacle, 112.5g dark brown sugar, 75g unsalted butter) into a pan, and heat on a low heat till the butter has melted, and everything is mixed in.
1. Bring the mixture to the boil and boil for 1 minute.
1. Once the mixture has boiled, remove from the heat and leave the sauce to cool fully. Stir occasionally so a skin isn't formed!

### For the Buttercream

1. Add your 300g butter to a bowl or stand mixer and beat on it's own for about 3-5 minutes until smooth and supple.
1. Add in the 600g icing sugar and beat in until fully mixed in.
1. Add in the 125g cooled sticky toffee sauce and mix again, until delicious and perfect.

### For the Decoration

1. Using your favourite piping tip, pipe your sticky toffee buttercream onto the cake!
1. Drizzle the cake with some more sticky toffee sauce, and then sprinkle with your favourite sprinkles!
1. Enjoy!!
