# Pear Brownie # 

## Ingredients ## 

- 220g butter, cut into cubes
- 150g dark chocolate (60%+ cocoa), roughly chopped
- 300g sugar
- 100g brown sugar, lightly packed
- 4 medium eggs
- 2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 140g cup plain flour
- ½ teaspoon sea salt
- 3 heaped tbsp dark cocoa
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- 2 pears, peeled, cored and cut into 1cm cubes

## Method ## 

1. Preheat oven to 180°C.
1. Line a sandwich tin with baking paper.
1. In a medium-large saucepan, melt the butter and chocolate over a low heat.
1. Whisk to smooth.
1. Add the sugar and heat gently for 1-2 minutes until some of the sugar dissolves.
1. Cool to room temperature.
1. Once cooled, whisk in 2 eggs until smooth.
1. Add the remaining 2 eggs and vanilla, then whisk until combined – don’t overmix at this stage as it will give you a too-cakey texture.
1. In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, salt, cocoa and cinnamon together.
1. Add the pear cubes and toss to coat in the dry ingredients.
1. Sprinkle the dry mixture over the chocolate batter.
1. Fold together until just combined.
1. Pour the batter into the prepared tin and smooth the top.
1. Bake in the centre of the oven for 30-40 minutes, rotating halfway through, until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out with a few moist crumbs sticking to it.
1. Cool completely in the tin before cutting into squares.
