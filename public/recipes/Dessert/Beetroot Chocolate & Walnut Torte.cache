# Beetroot Chocolate & Walnut Torte # 

This is from a Haloween food magazine that my mum showed me.

- 250g unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing
- 50g walnut halves or pieces
- 250g cooked beetroot, drained
- 1 orange, zest, plus extra to serve
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

- 3 eggs
- 250g light brown muscovado sugar
- 75g cornflour
- 75g cocoa powder
- 1 tsp baking powder
- crème fraîche, to serve

## Method ## 

1. Preheat the oven to 180°C.
2. Lightly grease the base and side of a 23cm springform tin and line with parchment
3. Put walnuts on a backing tray and roast for 4-5 minutes until lightly toasted. Cool, and chop finely.
4. Put the beetroot, orange zest, vanilla, and a pinch of salt in a food processor and blend till totally smooth.
5. Meanwhile, put the chocolate and butter in a heatproof bowl and sit over gently simmering water.
6. When it's melted, stir in the blended beetroot, leave to cool.
7. Whisk the eggs and sugar together until well combined and slightly frothy.
8. Gently fold in the chocolate beetroot mixture.
9. Stir in the cornflour, cocoa, and baking powder, then fold in the chopped walnuts until well combined.
10. Tip into the lined tin, and bake for 35-40 minutes until risen and cracked on top, but still gooey when pierced.
11. This can be served now, but the texture will be improved by being left for 24 hours.
