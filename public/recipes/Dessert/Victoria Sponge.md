# Victoria Sponge #

This is a recipe from the cookbook which came with my mother's Neff oven. I've changed it from 3 eggs to 5 as the quanitites weren't quite enough, and I've added the recipe for cream filling from [this recipe](https://www.reddit.com/r/GifRecipes/comments/bx2c5r/glutenfree_victoria_sponge_cake_recipe/)

## Ingredients ##

- 285g butter
- 285g caster sugar
- 285g self-raising four
- 5 eggs

### Cream Filling
- 250ml double cream
- 1 tbsp icing sugar
- ½ tsp vanilla extract

### Construction

- Extra icing sugar, maybe a teaspoon's worth.
- Jam

## Method ##

1. Preheat oven to 160°C.
2. Prepare 2x 20cm buttered lined tins.
3. Soften butter.
3. Cream butter and sugar in a mixer, for ~10 minutes. It should turn very pale as it encorporates lots of air to keep the sponge light.
4. Add the eggs and mix lightly.
5. Add the flour and mix lightly, taking care to not over mix.
5. Divide the mixture between tins.
5. Bake for 25-30 minutes.
1. The sponge will spring back when touched in the centre, a toothpick will emerge clean and there won't be a sizzling noise of the gas escaping.
1. Remove from oven.
1. Remove from tins and place on cooling racks.
1. When cold they can be constructed, or they can remain in a fridge overnight in a sealed container.

### Cream Filling

1. Beat together the cream, icing sugar and vanilla till stiff.

### Construction

1. Wait until the cakes are cold.
2. Spread the bottom layer with a thick layer of jam.
3. Pipe or spoon the cream filling on. If piping, make large dots around the edge before piping a filled spiral into the middle.
4. Carefully place the top layer on.
5. Dust with icing sugar using a sieve.

## Notes

- this works very well gluten free with dove farms self-raising flour.
