# Whole Orange Cake # 

This is a gluten free orange cake from [cookrepublic](https://www.cookrepublic.com/gluten-free-whole-orange-cake/) which sounds very interesting.

## Ingredients ## 

- 2 whole oranges (300g)
- 4 small-medium eggs
- 250g ground almonds or almond meal
- 180g rapadura sugar (a good substitue is Muscovado or Demerara according to [this site](https://www.spiceography.com/rapadura-substitute/))
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon vanilla powder or extract
- ½ teaspoon ground cardamom
- pinch of salt

## Method ## 

1. Wash and pat dry the 2 oranges.
2. Place in a small saucepan filled with water over medium heat and bring to a boil.
3. Reduce heat to low, cover and gently simmer for an hour. Check to see if water has evaporated and top up if required.
4. Pre-heat oven to 180°C (convection)/ 160°C (fan-forced).
10. Grease and line a 20cm square tin or 27cm X 17cm slice tin with baking paper.
5. Remove from heat and allow to cool.
6. Cut oranges in quarters and slice off the pith/seeds.
7. Place cute oranges (with skin) in the jug of a blender with the 4 eggs.
8. Blend for a minute on high until smooth.
9. Add the 250g ground almonds, 180g rapadura sugar, 1 tsp baking powder, ½ tsp vanilla, ½ tsp cardamom to the jug of the blender and process for a few seconds until just combined. (You can instead pour the orange and egg mixture in a bowl, add all the other ingredients and mix gently with a spoon until just combined. This however produces a coarser texture.)
10. Spoon the cake batter into the prepared tin. Bake in the pre-heated oven for approximately 40 minutes.
11. Remove from the oven and allow to cool in the pan slightly, before cutting into slices.
12. Enjoy warm or store in an air-tight tin in a cool corner of your kitchen for up to 3 days.
