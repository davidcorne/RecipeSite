INGREDIENTS
2cups heavy cream
⅔cup (4 ⅔ ounces)
granulated sugar
1tablespoon grated
lemon zest plus 6
tablespoons juice (2
lemons)
1
½
cups blueberries or
raspberries
SERVES 6INSTRUCTIONS
This dessert requires portioning into
individual servings. Reducing the cream
mixture to exactly 2 cups creates the best
consistency. Transfer the liquid to a 2-cup
heatproof liquid measuring cup once or
twice during boiling to monitor the
amount. Do not leave the cream
unattended, as it can boil over easily.
1. Combine cream, sugar, and lemon
zest in medium saucepan and bring to
boil over medium heat. Continue to
boil, stirring frequently to dissolve
WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS
Lemon posset is a silky, rich British
dessert with bright citrus 㤮㈴avor. We
found that using just the right
proportions of sugar and lemon juice
was the key to custard with a smooth,
luxurious consistency and a bright
enough 㤮㈴avor to balance the richness of
the cream. Lemon zest was essential to
making the lemon 㤮㈴avor
even more prominent. For
a posset with an
optimally dense, 㔠〠rm set, we reduced the cream-sugar mixture to
2 cups to evaporate some of the water before adding the lemon
juice, which in turn caused the mixture to solidify. Letting the
warm mixture rest for 20 minutes before straining and portioning
allowed the 㤮㈴avors to meld even more and ensured a silky-smooth
consistency. Pairing the dessert with fresh berries for textural
contrast helps keep it from feeling overly rich.

sugar. If mixture begins to boil over,
brie㤮㈴y remove from heat. Cook until
mixture is reduced to 2 cups, 8 to 12
minutes.
2. Remove saucepan from heat and stir
in lemon juice. Let sit until mixture is
cooled slightly and skin forms on top,
about 20 minutes. Strain through
㔠〠ne-mesh strainer into bowl; discard
zest. Divide mixture evenly among 6
individual ramekins or serving
glasses.
3. Refrigerate, uncovered, until set, at
least 3 hours. Once chilled, possets
can be wrapped in plastic wrap and
refrigerated for up to 2 days. Unwrap
and let sit at room temperature for 10
minutes before serving. Garnish with
berries and serve.
