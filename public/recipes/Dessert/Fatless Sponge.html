<title>Fatless Sponge</title>

# Fatless Sponge #

This is my great-grandmothers recipe for a fatless sponge. The secretingredient in this recipe is air. Without fat you need to really incorporateair into the mixture to get a really light fluffy cake. This means that steps5 and 7 need to be done very carefully so that you end up with a very lightmixture.

## Ingredients ##

- 4 Eggs
- 110g castor/icing sugar
- 220g self-raising flour

## Method ##

1. Preheat oven to 180 degrees C
2. Grease a 20cm / 8 inch round cake tin. Cover the bottom of the tin with greaseproof paper.
3. Crack the eggs into a bowl.
4. Add the sugar to the bowl.
5. Beat the eggs and sugar together until they turn white. This is to incorporate lots of air into the mixture. This helps get a light fluffy sponge.
6. Sift the flour into the bowl.
7. Fold the mixture together carefully maintaining the level of air in the mixture.
8. Fill the cake tin with the mixture.
9. Cook for 30 minutes. If when you take the cake out of the oven it is still hissing, this means it is still rising and should cook for 3-5 minutes more.

## Topping ##

This is a generic sponge recipe, and there are many things you can do with it.

- Jam and buttercream.
