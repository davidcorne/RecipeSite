This is originally from [here](https://www.carolinescooking.com/blueberry-clafoutis-with-gluten-free-option/).

## Ingredients ## 

- A little coconut oil, for skillet/dish
- 150ml cup milk
- ½ tsp vanilla
- 2 eggs
- 4 tbsp cup honey
- 90g cup Gluten Free Flour
- 1 pinch salt
- ½ lemon zest
- 140g blueberries

## Method ## 

1. Preheat oven to 190°C. 
2. Lightly grease a 8in/20cm cast iron skillet/frying pan or similar sized baking dish with some coconut oil.
3. Put the milk, vanilla, eggs and honey in a blender or food processor and blend until well combined. You may need to give it a stir by hand and then blend again as the honey can fall to the bottom.
4. Add the flour, salt and lemon zest and pulse again until just combined. Try not to overmix.
5. Pour the batter into the skillet/baking dish then place the blueberries in the mixture evenly.
6. Bake in the oven for approx 30-35 minutes until lightly browned around the edges and set. 
7. Allow to cool a couple minutes before serving. It will probably be puffed up when you take it out the oven and collapse after a minute. 
8. Sprinkle with a little icing sugar to serve, if desired.
