White chocolate blondies
Method
Grease a 21 x 21cm brownie tin with a little butter, then line the
base and sides with baking parchment. Place the butter and 100g white
chocolate in a bowl, suspended over a pan of gently simmering water.
Stir every few mins, until the butter and chocolate have melted. Remove
the bowl from the pan and leave to cool for 15 mins. Heat oven to
180C/160C fan/gas 4. Combine the flour and baking powder in a bowl,
with 1/4 tsp salt.
Place the sugar and eggs in a large bowl. Using an electric hand
whisk, beat the mixture until it looks thick and foamy – this will take a
few mins. The egg mixture is ready when it leaves a trail from the
beaters, which sits on the surface for 2 secs.
Add the vanilla to the melted chocolate and give it a good stir –
don’t worry if it has separated. Pour into the whisked eggs and sugar.
Use a spatula to gently fold everything together, until most of the buttery
streaks have been folded in. Sieve the flour mixture into the bowl and
fold together again, add the remaining chocolate chunks and stir until
well combined.

4.Pour the mixture into your tin, smoothing it into the corners. Bake for
30-35 mins, a skewer inserted to the centre should come out with
sticky crumbs, but no raw cake mixture. Cool completely in the tin – the
blondies will sink in the middle as they cool, just like brownies. Cut into
16 squares. The blondies will keep for 5 days in a sealed container.
