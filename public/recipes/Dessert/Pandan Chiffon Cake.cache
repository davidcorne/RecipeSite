# Pandan Chiffon Cake # 

This is a BBC good food recipe from September 2023.

## Ingredients ## 

- 140ml vegetable oil, plus extra for the tin
- 6 eggs, separated
- 200g caster sugar
- 140ml coconut milk (see tip, below)
- 1 tbsp pandan extract
- 200g self-raising flour
- 1 tbsp icing sugar, for dusting

## Method ## 

1. Heat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan.
1. Oil the base of a 23cm chiffon cake tin. It's important not to oil the sides, as the cake mixture will cling to them as it rises. This prevents the air bubbles collapsing. giving the cake its bouncy texture.
1. Whisk the egg yolks and half the caster sugar together in a large bowl with an electric whisk until the mixture becomes light and creamy, about 3 mins.
1. Mix in the vegetable oil, coconut milk and the pandan extract, until combined.
1. Clean the beaters, then beat the egg whites in a separate bowl until soft peaks form, about 3 mins.
1. Gradually add the remaining caster sugar, a spoonful at a time, while beating until the egg whites are stiff and shiny, about 3 mins.
1. Sift the flour and ¼ tsp salt into the egg yolk mixture.
1. Gently fold together using a large metal spoon until just combined, being careful not to overmix-you want to keep as much air in the batter as possible.
1. Using the metal spoon, gently fold roughly a third of the beaten egg whites into the cake batter to loosen it.
1. Fold in the remaining egg whites until no streaks remain, making sure you don't overmix.
1. Pour the batter into the prepared cake tin.
1. Bake on the middle shelf for 30 mins, or until golden brown. Insert a skewer into the centre of the cake, if it comes out clean, the cake is cooked; if not, return to the oven for another 5 mins then check again. 
1. Remove the cake from the oven and immediately invert the tin onto a cooling rack. 
1. Leave to cool completely in the tin upside-down. This helps prevent the cake from collapsing.
1. Carefully remove it from the tin by running a knife around the edges.
1. Transfer the cake to a serving plate and dust with icing sugar.
1. Will keep in an airtight container for three days.
