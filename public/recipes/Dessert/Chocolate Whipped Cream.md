# Chocolate Whipped Cream # 

This comes from [here](https://thefirstyearblog.com/chocolate-whipped-cream/) originally. I've reduced the yield, converted it to metric and added some notes.

## Ingredients ## 
- 300ml double cream
- 10g cocoa powder
- 25g icing sugar

## Method ## 

1. Place a metal mixing bowl and beater in the freezer for 15 minutes.
2. Add the ingredients to the bowl.
3. Whip on medium for ~4-5 minutes, or until stiff peaks form. Note: it's very easy to over-whip this, I whipped it on high for 1.20 and it was too stiff.
4. Serve/pipe.
