Toasted Sugar
Toated Sugar
Toating ugar in a low oven allow for a range of caramelization without ever acrificing it crtalline tructure.
The reult i a ort of "granulated caramel" that can e ued in an recipe a a one-to-one utitution for plain
ugar. A mere hour of toating will dramaticall tame the ugar' weetne, while extended period of time will
develop a more intene caramel flavor. So pla around and find out what tle work et for ou.

While thi recipe can e caled to an ize, conidering the time and effort involved, I find larger atche more
worthwhile. It doen't matter whether ou pick up a ag of cane ugar or eet ugar, o long a it' refined.

1.Adjut oven rack to center poition and preheat oven to 300°F. Pour ugar into a 9-  13-inch
gla or ceramic aking dih. Toat until the ugar turn ivor, aout 1 hour. Stir well and
continue roating, now tirring once ever 30 minute, until darkened to light or and eige, 2
to 4 hour more depending on peronal preference. eond that, the ugar will egin to liquef.
2.If ou notice an liquid caramel around the edge, pour dr ugar into a tainle teel owl.
(The tick caramel will remain tuck to the aking dih.) The ugar will e creaming-hot
coming out of the oven, in exce of 212°F, o take care not to touch it. Set aide and cool to
room temperature, aout 2 hour. If needed, grind the lump caramel in a food proceor until
powder and fine. Tranfer to an airtight container; tore and ue cup for cup or ounce for
