## Ingredients ## 

- 225g white chocolate, plus extra for decoration
- 450g cream cheese
- 4 large eggs
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 225g crème fraîche
- 250g digestive biscuits
- 100g unsalted butter, melted

## Method ## 

1. Preheat the oven to 120 C/250 F. Break up the chocolate and place on a baking tray. Place in the oven for 20 minutes then stir. Do this for another 40 minutes, stirring the chocolate every 5-10 minutes. You may need to blend the chocolate to make it smooth and give it the consistency of melted chocolate. The full recipe can be found at Food 52.
2. Grease and line a 23cm springform tin and turn the oven upto 150 C/300 F. In a food processor or ziplock bag, crush the digestives into crumbs and mix in the melted butter. Press into the base of the cake tin and pop in the fridge until you are ready to use.
3. In a bowl or stand mixer, beat the cream cheese until soft, then add the eggs one by one, with the vanilla extract.
4. Fold the crème fraîche into the caramelised white chocolate, then fold this into the cream cheese mixture.
5. Take the cake tin out of the fridge and pour the cheesecake mix into the tin. Bang the tin down on a firm surface to remove any air bubbles.
6. Bake in the oven for an hour, or until the centre is just firm.
7. Allow to rest for several hours to firm up before removing from the tin. Grate some white chocolate over the top of the cake and serve.
