Ultimate crème brûlée
Method
Preheat the oven to fan 160C/conventional 180C/gas 4. Sit four
175ml ramekins in a deep roasting tin at least 7.5cm deep (or a
large deep cake tin), one that will enable a baking tray to sit well
above the ramekins when laid across the top of the tin. Pour the two
cartons of cream into a medium pan with the milk. Lay the vanilla
pod on a board and slice lengthways through the middle with a
sharp knife to split it in two. Use the tip of the knife to scrape out all
the tiny seeds into the cream mixture. Drop the vanilla pod in as
well, and set aside.
Put the egg yolks and sugar in a mixing bowl and whisk for 1
minute with an electric hand whisk until paler in colour and a bit
fluffy. Put the pan with the cream on a medium heat and bring
almost to the boil. As soon as you see bubbles appear round the
edge, take the pan off the heat.
Pour the hot cream into the beaten egg yolks, stirring with a wire
Ingredients

(284ml) plus 1 small (142ml)

whisk as you do so, and scraping out the seeds from the pan. Set a
fine sieve over a large wide jug or bowl and pour the hot ixture
through to strain it, encouraging any stray vanilla seeds through at
the end. Using a big spoon, scoop off all the pale foam that is sitting
on the top of the liquid (this will be several spoonfuls) and discard.
Give the mixture a stir.
Pour in enough hot water (from the tap is fine) into the roasting
tin to come about 1.5cm up the sides of the ramekins. Pour the hot
cream into the ramekins so you fill them up right to the top – it’s
easier to spoon in the last little bit. Put them in the oven and lay a
baking sheet over the top of the tin so it sits well above the
ramekins and completely covers them, but not the whole tin, leaving
a small gap at one side to allow air to circulate. Bake for 30-35
minutes until the mixture is softly set. To check, gently sway the
roasting tin and if the crème brûlées are ready, they will wobble a
bit like a jelly in the middle. Don’t let them get too firm.
Lift the ramekins out of the roasting tin with oven gloves and set
them on a wire rack to cool for a couple of minutes only, then put in
the fridge to cool completely. This can be done overnight without
affecting the texture.
When ready to serve, wipe round the top edge of the dishes,
sprinkle 1½ tsp of caster sugar over each ramekin and spread it out
with the back of a spoon to completely cover (Anne Willan’s tip for
an even layer). Spray with a little water using a fine spray (the sort
you buy in a craft shop) to just dampen the sugar – then use a blow
torch to caramelise it. Hold the flame just above the sugar and keep
moving it round and round until caramelised. Serve when the brûlée
is firm, or within an hour or two.
