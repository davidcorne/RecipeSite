# Vanilla Cupcake # 

This is a moderately low sugar recipe I used for a child's birthday cupcakes. Its' originally from [here](https://www.yummytoddlerfood.com/lower-sugar-vanilla-cupcakes/). They can easily be doubled or more.

## Ingredients ## 

- 115g unsalted butter, softened at room temperature (1 stick)
- 100g sugar
- 2 large eggs (at room temperature if possible)
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 120ml whole milk (at room temperature if possible)
- 160g all-purpose flour
- 1¼ teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt

## Method ## 

1. Preheat the oven to 175°C and line a muffin tin with paper cupcake liners.
1. Add the butter and sugar to a medium bowl.
1. Beat with a hand-held electric mixer on medium-high speed until light, fluffy, and thick or about 3-5 minutes. 
1. Add in the eggs one at a time, beating in between to fully incorporate each egg.
1. Add in the vanilla.
1. Add the baking powder, salt, and half of the flour to the bowl. Beat on the lowest speed.
1. Add half of the milk. Beat on the lowest speed.
1. Add the remaining flour and milk and beat on the lowest speed to just combine the batter.  
1. Divide the batter among the paper liners, filling each cup with about ¼ cup batter.  
1. Bake for 20-22 minutes or until just golden brown around the edges and a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean.
1. Remove from the oven. Transfer cupcakes to a wire rack and let cool completely. 
1. Frost as desired.
