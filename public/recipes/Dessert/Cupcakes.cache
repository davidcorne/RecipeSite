## Ingredients ## 

- 110g softened butter
- 110g golden caster sugar
- 2 large eggs
- ½ tsp vanilla extract
- 110g self-raising flour

## Method ## 

1. Heat oven to 180°C/160°C fan and fill a 12 cupcake tray with cases.
1. Using an electric whisk beat 110g softened butter and 110g golden caster sugar together until pale and fluffy then whisk in 2 large eggs, one at a time, scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition.
1. Add ½ tsp vanilla extract, 110g self-raising flour and a pinch of salt, whisk until just combined then spoon the mixture into the cupcake cases.
1. Bake for 15 mins until golden brown and a skewer inserted into the middle of each cake comes out clean. Leave to cool completely on a wire rack.
1. Top with icing/buttercream/chocolate or anything else, or leave them plain. 

## Notes

- This recipe halves nicely.
- I've made this using gluten free flour (Dove Farm's Freee) and it worked well as a 1:1 substitution.
- I've made these into chocolate cupcakes substituting 40g of flour for coco powder, and adding a handful of dark chocolate chips.
- This is a great recipe to cook with kids.
