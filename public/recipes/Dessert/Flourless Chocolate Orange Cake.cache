# Flourless Chocolate Orange Cake # 

By Richard Matthews, used to work at Delcam but moved to Shefield. Copied from Tessa.

## Ingredients ## 

- 2 small thin-skinned oranges (375g) or 1 large
- 6 eggs
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- Â½ teaspoon bicarbonate of soda
- 200g ground almonds
- 250g caster sugar
- 50g cocoa

## Method ## 

I have always just put in more baking powder and no bicarbonate of
soda. I also melt some dark chocolate to go in and reduce the amount
of sugar a bit (but not the cocoa). We don't have any scales so I
estimate the amounts a bit but the recipe seems to be fairly forgiving
and come out well anyway.

1. Put oranges whole in pan with some cold water, bring to boil, cook until soft (2 hours? - it says in my notes). I think I have always done them for less than an hour. Sometimes you get a bit of a hard bit on the skin where they were resting on the bottom of the pan and I cut this off as well as any other tough/hard bits.
2. Pulp everything in food processor
3. Preheat oven to 180 degrees, butter and line 20 cm spring-form tin (I have always used both butter and baking paper on the tin).
4. Add rest of ingredients, run motor until fine cohesive cake mixture.
5.> Pour/scrape into cake tin (sometimes I have got a very runny mixtures that pours, other times less so, it doesn't seem to matter too much), bake for an hour. Check after 45 mins as may need to cover with foil. I can't remember how long it has actually taken when I did it as one cake. When I did the cupcakes yesterday they took a bit under twenty minutes. I find that the test of sticking a sharp knife or similar in and seeing when it comes out clean does not entirely work for gluten free stuff, at least with this recipe it does not seem to ever come out entirely clean, presumably until it burns. I still do the check but only wait until it comes out fairly clean.

For the topping I have always done a chocolate fudge icing with butter, dark chocolate, icing sugar, vanilla and milk. When I have done it as a cake I have done something much softer than I did on the cupcakes but for them I added golden syrup and more icing sugar so it would set harder and be less likely to make a mess whilst being transported.
