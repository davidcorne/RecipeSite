Creme Anglaise
# Creme Anglaise # 

This is originally from [here](https://www.gatherandfeast.com/almond-milk-cr%C3%A8me-anglaise) with the almond milk replaced with oat milk.

## Ingredients ## 

- 500ml oat milk
- 2 eggs
- 2 tbs corn flour
- 1 tsp vanilla bean powder or paste
- 2 tbs maple syrup
- 2 tbs brandy (optional)

## Method ## 

1. Heat the oat milk with the vanilla and maple in a small saucepan, bring to boiling point and remove from the heat.
2. In a medium mixing bowl beat the eggs and 1 tbs of the cornflour until light and slightly aerated.
3. Quickly pour the hot milk over the egg mix and whisk well.
4. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and cook over a gentle heat. 
5. Mix the extra 1 tbs of corn flour with a tsp of water and add to the milk mixture.
6. Continue stirring non stop with a wooden spoon until the anglaise thickens and coats the back of the spoon.
7. Remove from the heat and keep whisking for a few minutes to ensure the anglaise stays smooth as it cools.
8. Serve warm or cold. Delish!
