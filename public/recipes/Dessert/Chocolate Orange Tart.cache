Chocolate orange tart
Method
Put the dates in a bowl, cover with boiling water and leave to soak
for 20 mins. Meanwhile, whizz the ingredients for the crust in a food
processor until combined. Tip the mixture into a 23cm loose- bottomed
fluted tart tin, using your fingers to spread it evenly across the base and
push into the fluted sides. Cover with cling film and chill while you make
the filling.
Drain the dates and put in a blender with the zest and juice of 1
orange, the coconut oil, honey and cacao. Whizz together until mostly
smooth, then scrape into the chilled crust and smooth with the back of a
spoon. Chill for at least 1 hr. Remove from the fridge 10 mins before
serving and sprinkle with the remaining orange zest and extra cacao.
