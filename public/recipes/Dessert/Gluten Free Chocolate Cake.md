# Gluten Free Chocolate Cake # 

This is a recipe originally from [here](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a19473626/best-flourless-chocolate-cake-recipe/).


## Ingredients ## 

### Cake
- Cooking spray, for pan
- 170g bittersweet chocolate, roughly chopped
- 113g butter, cut into large chunks
- 1 tsp. instant espresso powder
- 60ml hot water
- 200g sugar
- 4 large eggs
- 75g unsweetened cocoa powder (preferably Dutch process)

### Ganache
- 120ml double cream
- 175g semisweet chocolate chips
- Raspberries, for serving

## Method ## 

### Cake
1. Preheat oven to 175Â°C and grease an 8" springform pan with cooking spray. 
1. Place a small saucepan filled halfway with water over medium heat and bring to a simmer.
1. Place bittersweet chocolate and butter in a heatproof bowl and set over the simmering pot. Stir until chocolate and butter are completely melted.
1. Turn off heat and remove bowl from saucepan. 
1. Dissolve espresso powder in hot water.
1. Add sugar and espresso to melted chocolate and whisk until completely combined then add eggs and whisk to combine.
1. Stir in cocoa powder.  
1. Pour batter into prepared springform pan and bake until just set in the middle and a thin crust forms, about 35 minutes.  
1. Let cake cool for 15 minutes, then remove sides of springform pan.
1. Let cake cool completely. 

### Ganache
1. Meanwhile, place heavy cream in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer.
1. Place chocolate chips in a heatproof bowl then pour hot cream over chocolate chips.
1. Let sit 1 minute, then whisk to combine. 
1. Pour ganache over cake and smooth with an offset spatula.
1. Place in refrigerator until set, 10 minutes. 
1. Serve with raspberries. 

## Dave's Notes
I think that this can be made into an orange cake:

- Add ~1tsp orange essence to the melted chocolate in the cake stage
- Add the zest of an orange to the ganache
- Serve with orange segments
