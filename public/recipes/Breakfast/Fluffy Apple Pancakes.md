# Fluffy Apple Pancakes # 

This is a nice low sugar pancake recipe from [here](https://lovefoodies.com/fluffy-apple-pancakes/). The sweetness comes from the apple included in it, they also work gluten free.

## Ingredients ## 

- 125g plain flour
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- Â½ teaspoon baking powder
- pinch salt
- 1 egg, separated
- 1 apple, cored and grated
- 150 ml milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- cinnamon to taste
- 1 tablespoon oil or spray for cooking

## Method ## 

1. Place sieved flour, sugar, vanilla, salt, baking powder milk and egg yolk in a bowl and whisk.
1. In a separate bowl, whisk egg white until fluffy soft peaks
1. Grate the apple using large holes in grater and lightly squeeze excess juice.
1. Add the grated apple to the batter.
1. Lightly fold in the egg white to the batter.
1. Heat a small pan with a drop of oil and place 2 tablespoons of batter in the pan on low heat. When golden, turn the pancake over and allow to cook until both sides are golden.
1. Serve warm with a sprinkling of sugar and cinnamon to your taste.

## Notes

This works well gluten free (I used Dove Farms's Gluten Free Plain Flour) and with oat milk.
