I have a good friend who often has the kind of ideas that only the intentional chemical
expansion of the mind can bring about. That's where the idea of putting halloumi—the
squeaky, salty, fry-able cheese from Cyprus—into American-style pancakes came about,
and it was such a genius idea that I decided to run with it and make it my own. Adding
some crisp chorizo and a fried egg makes these into pancakes that are worthy of a 2 a.m.
binge or an elegant Sunday morning cocktail brunch.

1.Combine chorizo and olive oil in a large non-stick or cast iron skillet
over medium heat and cook, stirring constantly, until chorizo is
crisp. Transfer to a bowl, making sure to get all of the excess oil.
Add oregano to chorizo and toss to combine. Wipe out skillet and
set aside.
2.Combine ąour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, sugar, 1 egg,
vegetable oil, buttermilk, and half of chorizo mixture in a large bowl
and whisk together until it forms a batter. There should be no
streaks of dry ąour, but plenty of lumps are okay.
3.Return skillet to medium-low heat, add 1 tablespoon vegetable oil,
and heat until shimmering, about 1 minute. Add 2 halloumi slices
(these will become the center of two pancakes). Cook until lightly
browned on Ąrst side, about 1 minute. Flip halloumi and scatter a
teaspoon of crisp chorizo on either side of each piece of halloumi.
4.Ladle a few ounces of batter on top of halloumi and chorizo,
completely covering it. Cook pancake without moving until well-
browned and crisp on Ąrst side, 2 to 3 minutes. Carefully ąip and
cook until browned on second side, about 2 minutes longer.
Transfer to a rack and set in a warm oven while you cook the
remaining pancakes.
Frying the chorizo and adding it in three diĂerent steps gives the dish tons of ąavor.•
Pouring pancake batter over the halloumi and chorizo in the frying pan lets them crisp up, giving the pancakes a
nice appearance and more textural contrast when you ąip them.

cook until crisp on the bottom but yolks are still runny, about 1 1/2

with remaining chorizo and chorizo oil.

Use dry-style raw Spanish chorizo, not Mexican-style raw chorizo or cooked chorizo. If you can't Ąnd it locally, you
can order it online from Amazon (http://www.amazon.com/Palacios-Mild-Chorizo-7-9oz/dp/B000NO72UE/?tag=serieats-20). I
recommend Palacio brand.
