Brown Butter Almond Milk Waffles
 
 
Waffles made with brown butter and almond milk. Top with

or brunch!
Author: The Worktop
Recipe type: Breakfast and Brunch
Serves: 6 Waffles
Ingredients
4 tablespoons (115g) butter
2 cups (470ml) almond milk
2 eggs, separated
2 tablespoons honey
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups (270g) all-purpose flour
4 teaspoon baking powder
¼ teaspoon salt
Instructions
1. In a small saucepan over medium to medium-hight heat, melt the butter and cook, stirring
often, until the butter becomes a light brown color, 5-8 minutes. Stir the butter often so it
does not stick to the bottom of the pan and burn. Pour into a small bowl and let cool.
2. In a medium bowl, beat together the almond milk, egg yolks, honey and vanilla. Mix in the
brown butter.
3. In a separate medium bowl, mix together the dry ingredients. Slowly pour in the almond
milk mixture, and mix well.
4. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites using a hand mixer on low speed until soft peaks
form.
5. Carefully fold the egg whites into the batter.
6. Heat waffle iron until very hot. Coat waffle iron with nonstick spray and carefully pour or
spoon (I use a ½ cup measuring spoon) batter onto the waffle iron, quickly spreading it to
cover the surface. The amount of batter you need will depend on your machine.
7. Cook waffles until golden brown and cooked through. See notes below on how to
determine when a waffle is done.
Notes
To determine if a waffle is done, watch the steam escape from the waffle maker. When the
steam becomes very thin and almost stops, the waffle will be ready. Once the steam
completely stops, the waffle will be well-done.
