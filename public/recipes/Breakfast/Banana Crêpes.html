# Banana Pancakes # 

This is originally from a reddit post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/5viq3x/besides_banana_bread_what_are_some_tasty_things/de2gxvz/), so it's a little vague.

    Best pancakes ever. They're thinner and more crepe like, but have all the heartiness of a pancake. 


## Ingredients ## 

- 1 tbsp sugar
- 1 cup flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- a little bit of salt and a dash of nutmeg
- 1 egg
- 2 bananas, mashed well
- 2 tbsp melted butter
- 1 tsp vanilla
- Â¾-1 cup milk
- Blueberries, optional

## Method ## 

Note, this is the aproximate method.

- Mix dry ingredients together.
- Mix the wet ingredients together in a seperate bowl.
- Stir the dry ingredients into the wet, until well combined.
- Fry in a little oil or butter.

You can throw some blueberries in right after you put the batter in the pan.
