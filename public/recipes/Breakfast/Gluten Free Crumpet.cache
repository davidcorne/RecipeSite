Gluten Free Crumpet
# Gluten Free Crumpet # 

This is from [here](https://glutenfreecuppatea.co.uk/2019/07/16/gluten-free-crumpets-recipe-dairy-free-vegan/).

## Ingredients ## 

- 400 ml milk (dairy free milk if you're vegan/dairy free OR lactose free milk if you're low FODMAP)
- 1 tsp caster sugar
- 1 tbsp yeast (I use dry active yeast) (ensure it is gluten free)
- 300 g gluten free self raising flour (I've tried using gluten free bread flour and gluten free plain flour - they both came out dryer and less fluffy)
- ½ tsp salt
- ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda

## Method ## 

1. Place your 400ml milk into a glass jug and heat up to around 43°C (this is just warm - I used my cooking thermometer to check)
1. Add your tsp caster sugar, tbsp yeast to the warm milk and stir.
1. Leave until the mixture starts to get a little frothy - about 10 minutes.
1. In a mixing bowl add your 300g flour, ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda and ½ tsp salt.
1. Then add in your milk mixture and stir together until smooth. It should be quite thick, but not too thick! Do this for a couple of minutes, I used a handheld whisk.
1. Leave to prove, covered in a warm place for about 90 minutes (no less than an hour). My oven has a proving setting so I left it in there. Make sure you bowl is big enough so it doesn't over prove, there should be some air bubbles on the top once it's done.
1. If your mixture has thickened too much you could add a little warm water at this stage (a tbsp or two, but it should be ok).
1. Heat up a frying pan and add some oil to it.
1. Place either a couple of egg rings or biscuit cutters in the pan.
1. Once the pan is hot enough (medium heat), put two and a half tbsp in each ring and allow to cook for about 5 minutes. Little air bubbles should start to appear on the surface (hopefully!). If they don't then don't worry too much.
1. Using tongs, lift off the rings and then flip the crumpets onto the other side for about a minute (The top of the crumpet should basically be dry so when you flip it there should be no mess).
1. Remove from the pan and repeat with the rest of the batter.
1. Serve hot from the pan or place in your toaster to reheat. Serve with butter, spread, golden syrup, jam, cheese... or whatever you fancy! Enjoy with a cuppa!
