# Fluffy Maple Pancakes # 

This is from [here](http://www.theveganbeauty.com/fluffy-maple-pancakes/).

## Ingredients ## 

- 1½ cups all purpose flour
- 2 tbsp cornstarch
- 2 tsp baking powder
- ½ tsp cinnamon
- 6 tbsp maple syrup
- 2 tsp apple cider vinegar
- 1 cup almond milk
- 1 tbsp melted coconut oil

## Method ## 

1. In a medium bowl, mix the dry ingredients and then add the wet ingredients.
2. Using a whisk, or fork, combine all the ingredients until the mixture is thick but still runny.
3. Heat a frying pan on medium heat. Use a coconut oil spray to oil the pan, or use a little bit of oil.
4. Using a ¼ cup, pour the batter onto the pan and cook for up to 1 minute on the first side. You will know the pancake is ready to flip when there are air bubbles around the edges and a few in the center.
5. Repeat with all the batter.
6. Serve with fresh berries, maple syrup, and/or powdered sugar.
