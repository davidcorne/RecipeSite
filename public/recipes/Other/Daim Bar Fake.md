# Daim Bar Fake # 

This is a good sounding fake version of a Daim bar, I got it from [here](https://sortedfood.com/recipe/daim).

## Ingredients ## 

- 100g butter
- 275g caster sugar
- 50g golden syrup
- 100g ground almonds
- 300g milk chocolate

## Method ## 

1. Weigh the butter, sugar and syrup into a saucepan and heat on the hob, without stirring with a spoon (just occasionally swill the mixture).
1. Heat to 150°C.
1. Dump in the ground almonds when the caramel reaches 150°C, then stir and heat back to 150°C again.
1. Transfer the mixture into a silicon mould, spread flat to about 1cm thick and allow to cool slightly to harden up. Not completely cold though or it will be tricky to cut.
1. Turn the slab of almond brittle out onto a board and cut into your bar-shaped pieces whilst it's still a little warm and won't crack.
1. Melt the milk chocolate in a bowl over a pan of simmering water, then use to coat the cooled dime bars. (Best done by arranging the bars on a wire rack over a tray then dribbling the chocolate over to get a smooth finish.)
1. Cool to set, then turn over and chocolate coat the bottoms. Cool again before serving.
