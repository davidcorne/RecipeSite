## Making the Starter ## 

The flour types you want to use are; Quinoa Flour, Buckwheat, Brown Rice Flour, Teff Flour, or other gluten free whole grain flours.

The one I've seen most recommended is Quinoa Flour. 

The starter builds up over time as you add to it. Each time you add flour and water you want to mix it to a paste, and cover the bowl loosely. Then leave the container in a warm place.

1. Get a 500ml glass bowl or jar, and a wet a clean tea towel, wring it out well. Use this to cover the bowl loosely.
2. Follow this table for feed timings and amounts.

Time             | Activity
-----------------|---------
Day 1 - 0 Hours  | Add 1 tbsp flour, 1 tbsp water.
Day 1 - 12 Hours | Add 1 tbsp flour, 1 tbsp water.
Day 2 - 24 Hours | Add 1 tbsp flour, 1 tbsp water.
Day 2 - 36 Hours | Add 1 tbsp flour, 1 tbsp water.
Day 3 - 48 Hours | Add 2 tbsp flour, 2 tbsp water. Larger, to boost the starter.
Day 3 - 60 Hours | Add 2 tbsp flour, 2 tbsp water.

At this point it should be bubbly and about doubled in size. If not, continue feeding until it is.

### Bowl vs. jar

A lot of things recommend using a bowl, but George Eats has some sensible advice about using a jar:
> Keeping your starter in a decent sized glass jar is helpful, as you can see the bubbles around the edges. It is also a great idea to use a rubber band or tape to keep track of where the starter sits in the container. This is because the starter will eventually start to grow, and having a measure is a great way of seeing overnight growth progress.

## Using the Starter

You can either dispose of any unused starter after bread making or keep and feed it regularly until your next baking session. But you'll take some and make it into ferment. Here's the Doves Farm sourdough white loaf recipe:

### Ingredients

#### Ferment
- 50g starter (from above)
- 75g FREEE White Bread Flour
- 100ml tepid water

#### First Dough Batter
- 225ml ferment (from above)
- 150g FREEE White Bread Flour
- 150ml tepid milk
- ½ tsp salt

#### Second Dough Batter
- 525ml 1st dough batter (from above)
- 150g FREEE White Bread Flour
- 100ml tepid milk
- 1 tbsp oil
- flour, for dusting

### Making the Ferment

1. Once your starter is bubbly, stir the starter and then measure 50g of the starter into a mixing bowl.
2. Add 75g flour and 100ml water, stir to make a paste.
3. Invert a larger mixing bowl over the bowl of ferment and leave in a warm place for 4-12 hours until bubbles appear.
4. When bubbly, your ferment is ready to use 

### 1st Dough Batter

- Add 150g of white bread flour and 150ml of milk to the bowl of ferment and stir to mix.
- Add the salt, stirring to make a smooth batter.
- Invert a larger mixing bowl over the dough batter and leave in a warm place until double in size which may take 2 – 12 hours.

### 2nd Dough Batter

- Dust the inside of the banneton liberally with flour and scatter flour on a large oven tray.
- Add 150g of white bread flour and 100ml of milk to the 1st batter and stir until smooth.
- Drizzle the oil over the sticky batter and, using a spatula, turn the mixture a couple of times in the bowl to encourage the formation of an oily, doughy mass.
- Tip the dough into the prepared banneton and cover with an upturned mixing bowl.
- Leave in a warm place to double in size which may take 2– 12 hours.
- Pre-heat the oven.
- Gently turn the bread out of the banneton onto the prepared oven tray.
- Bake for 35 - 40 minutes.
- Take the bread out of the oven and cool completely before slicing.

## Continue Using It

An active starter can be kept in a refrigerator and will need feeding every 7 – 10 days. It can also be frozen but needs a warm place, and flour and water feeds to re-establish its activity. 

### Schedule for Weekend Baking

- **Friday Evening:** Feed your starter, cover the jar, and leave it on the counter overnight. If you keep your starter in the fridge, it might need two feedings to perk back up (feed it in the morning & in the evening).
- **Saturday Morning:** Check your starter: if it’s alive and bubbling, you can make the dough to rise during the day. Or, feed it again in the afternoon to make the dough in the evening for an overnight rise.
- **Saturday Morning/Evening (or whenever your starter is ready):** Make the dough. Leave on the counter to bulk rise at room temperature. In the summer, if your dough rises quickly and you’re not ready to bake, cover the whole bowl with lightly oiled wrap and chill until ready to use.
- **Sunday Morning:** cut and shape the dough. Place in Dutch oven for second rise. Slash. Bake. Cool. Eat.

## Discard

I haven't got a clear reference on this, but discard is often mentioned but I can't tell how much there will be for a less active starter. Ideas:
