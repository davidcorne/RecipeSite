One of the keys to a great cake is texture. Often what 
you’re going for is something light and airy, and for this 
you need lots of air in the mixture.
How to get that airiness? 
The secret’s in the mixing. 
With traditional mixers, all too often the batter ends up 
sticking to the sides of the bowl, leaving lumps instead 
of a smooth consistency. To combat this, the Sage Bakery 
Boss™ comes with a scraper mixer that wipes the sides 
and bottom of the bowl with every turn. So it mixes faster 
and more efficiently, incorporating plenty of air into the 
batter to give you just the light, springy texture you’re 
looking for. 
Your Sage Bakery Boss™ is a great piece of kit for creativity, 
and no doubt you can’t wait to get in the kitchen and try it 
out. The accompanying book will help you do just that: it’s 
full of essential info about the 5 core ingredients of baking, 
plus a bunch of delicious recipes for you to play  
around with.
Well, what are you waiting for? Show the Sage Bakery 
Boss™ who’s boss – and get baking!

Eggs can affect a recipe in a range of ways, depending 
on how they are treated. What other ingredient could 
emulsify, aerate, bind, leaven, thicken, and set mixtures? 
No ingredient is so versatile, in fact to find an alternative, 
you would have to turn to a range of ingredients like 
potato starch flour to bind, baking soda to leaven, agar to 
thicken, and soy milk to glaze. 
When egg whites are whipped, the structure of the protein 
unfolds and they orientate around the small pockets of air 
to create a uniform foam structure. Fats, including the fats 
in the yolk, will prevent the white from reaching its full 
volume, so it’s important to separate without breaking  
the yolk. The whisk and the bowl also need to be free  
from moisture or residual fats, and plastic bowls should  
be avoided. 
As the foam is approaching readiness, it will start to look 
shiny. Stop and check if stiff peaks have formed. Watch the 
foam closely, as it will collapse if over-whipped, and it can’t 
be reversed. 
Sage TIP
Before using an egg for baking, it's a good idea to check  
if it's fresh. As eggs age, the size of the air cell grows.  
Put the raw egg into a bowl of cold water deep enough to 
completely cover it. If it rolls around on the bottom, it’s 
fresh and good for baking. If it stands up on its point, it’s 
older and is best saved for scrambled eggs for breakfast.  
If it rises to the surface, it is too old to use. 
The Bakery Boss™ comes with a whisk that is essential  
for giving egg whites the desired 'stiff peak' structure. 
Begin by using the KNEADING setting to start mixing 
and then slowly work your way up to the WHISKING 
setting. The glass bowl makes it easy to see the 
consistency of the peaks. Just be careful not to over-beat 
as beautifully stiffed peaks and turn grainy and dull.

Flour is an intriguing and versatile ingredient. It is quite 
incredible how foods with such dramatically different 
textures like crumbly shortbread, compared with a fluffy 
croissant, a quiche crust or a bread roll, all build their 
structure using flour. 
While the ingredients you mix with flour plays a part,  
the order in which you add them and the way you combine 
them is far more important. It’s this that determines 
how much the glutens (the proteins that give dough its 
elasticity) are developed.
The structure of any dough is essentially determined by 
how liquids (water or milk) and flour react to one another. 
The length of time the dough is kneaded as well as the 
amount of time the gluten in the flour is in contact with 
liquid is what determines the elasticity of the glutens and 
hence the dough. Bread dough needs wet flour, heavy 
kneading and a decent proving time, to maximise its 
elasticity. But for a crisp, flaky pastry, the opposite is true 
and gluten development needs to be kept to a minimum. 
This means adding the fat to the flour before any liquid to 
form a moisture barrier around the glutens. 
The Bakery Boss™ loves making dough – a lot of dough. 
The high powered motor combined with extra sturdy 
construction, the Bakery Boss™ can make enough dough 
for two large loaves of bread. The specially designed 
dough hook pushes the dough down into the mixing bowl 
and kneads it with high pressure against the bowl wall, 
while the bottom hook folds and brings dough ball back 
up to the top of the dough hook to repeat the kneading 
cycle. Fast, capable, and very easy.

combine. Place dough ball into a lightly oiled bowl, cover 
and rest in a warm draught free place for 30–40 minutes or 
until dough has doubled in size. Turn dough out on bench 
surface and knock back (punch) the dough to remove excess 
air, using hands gently push the dough to make a rough 
rectangle, about 30 x 20cm. 
4. Bring one long edge of the dough into the centre then bring 
the other long edge in. Pinch seam together to seal. Brush 
with a little water and sprinkle generously with extra quinoa. 
Flip dough over so the seam is down and repeat with water 
and quinoa. Cover with a clean towel and allow to rise again 
for about 30 minutes until doubled in size.
5. Preheat oven to 190¬°C fan assisted . 
6. Once doubled in size, cut three shallow slits with a sharp 
knife on the top of the loaf.
7. Bake in oven for 30–35 minutes or until golden brown and 
hollow when tapped on top. Transfer to a wire rack to cool 
completely. Place in oven for 10 minutes again if serving hot.

More Than a Sweet Tooth.

Simple eggs whites can expand up to 8 times their 
size when whipped into a meringue. This expansion 
occurs as air is whisked into the egg whites to expose 
the hydrophilic (water loving) and hydrophobic (water 
fearing) sections. The hydrophobic parts of proteins orient 
themselves around the incorporated air and will continue 
to do so as more whipping and air divides existing air 
bubbles into more numerous bubbles, hence the resulting 
foam increasing in volume. Depending on how long the 
egg whites are beaten, a foam can be classified as soft, 
firm, or stiff.
However the air bubbles in whipped egg whites will 
deflate easily over time. Gradually adding sugar to egg 
whites creates a more stable foam. Sugar attracts water 
which makes for a stronger and longer-lasting protein 
structure by slowing the drainage of water away from the 
liquid surrounding the air bubbles. The result is smaller 
but more stable air bubbles. 
With the addition of sugar, the whipped egg white foam 
is also stable enough to be baked in the oven to form a 
meringue. And how do I know if the sugar is dissolved? 
Rub a little meringue between your fingers. If it’s still 
grainy more mixing time required.
The Bakery Boss™ features a new Whisk design.  
With 30% more wire arms and 25% thinner gauge that 
not only improves separation of egg white protein and 
the introduction of air into the mix, it results in faster 
dissolving of sugar.

Finely grated rind of 1 lemon
L cup (80ml) lemon juice
70g chilled butter
Swiss Meringue
3 eggs whites (105g) 
¾ cup (165g) caster sugar
Pinch cream of tartar
Method
1. Pr          eheat oven to 160°C fan assisted . Grease and line a  
(25cm x 30cm) lamington pan with baking paper. 
2. Sift flour and baking powder together; set aside. 
3. Assemble mixer with the scraper beater and the large mixer 
bowl. Add butter and sugar to bowl. Slowly turn mixer to 
CREAMING/BEATING for 3–4 minutes or until pale and 
creamy.
4. Combine cream, eggs and vanilla in a jug. Reduce speed and 
add half the liquid mixture, then half the flour mixture then 
repeat with the liquid and flour. Don’t over mix. Spread mixture 
into prepared pan.
5. Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes or until a skewer inserted 
in centre comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before turning  
out onto a wire rack lined with baking paper. Leave turned 
upside down.
6. Meanwhile, to make the lemon curd, beat the egg, egg yolks and 
strain into a heat proof bowl. Whisk through sugar, lemon rind 
and juice and butter. 
7. Place bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, making sure 
the base of the bowl does not touch the water. Stir the mixture 
over simmering water for about 15–20 minutes, or until curd has 
thickened. 
8. Transfer to another bowl, cover with plastic wrap with a small 
side of the bowl uncovered to allow steam to escape and 
refrigerate until cold.
9. When ready to assemble, make the meringue. Place egg whites, 
sugar and cream of tartar into the small mixer bowl. Place bowl 
carefully into a saucepan of simmering water and gently whisk 
for 3–4 minutes or until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture 
has warmed through. Assemble the mixer with the scraper  
whisk onto the mixer. Whisk on the AERATE/WHIP for about  
2 minutes or until mixture has thickened but not too stiff.
10. To assemble, using a 5.5cm round cutter cut 16 rounds from  
the cake. Spread 1–2 teaspoons of lemon curd onto half of  
the rounds. With the remaining rounds pipe or shape with a 
spoon, approximately 2 tablespoons of meringue onto each. 
Place meringue rounds on top of lemon curd. 
11. Using a chef’s blow torch, lightly colour outside of meringue.

Lemon Shortbread 
Prep 15 minutes / Cook 30 minutes 
Makes 22
250g butter, softened
½ cup (110g) caster sugar
1 tablespoon finely grated lemon rind
2¼ cups (335g) plain flour
Icing
1 cup (160g) icing sugar, sifted
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon milk or water
Method
1. Pr          eheat oven to 150°C fan assisted . Line two baking trays 
with baking paper.
2. Assemble mixer using the scraper beater. Add butter, caster 
sugar and lemon rind in mixer bowl. Slowly turn the mixer

rind start to combine. Gradually increase to CREAMING/
BEATING setting. Beat mixture for about 5 minutes or until 
butter is very pale in colour.
3. Reduce speed to LIGHT MIXING setting and gradually 
add flour. Once all flour is added, increase speed slightly to 
mix thoroughly for 30 seconds.
4. Lightly knead dough on a flat surface. 
Tip
1. The buttery texture of the mixture should not need a floured 
surface, but if very sticky on your work surface then lightly 
flour the surface.
2. Using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll the mixture out to a 
1cm thickness. Using a 5cm round pastry cutter, cut rounds 
of shortbread and place onto prepared trays. Reshape 
shortbread mixture to get as many rounds as possible. 
Refrigerate shortbread rounds for 15 minutes. 
3. Bake rounds for about 25–30 minutes or until firm. Allow to  
cool on trays for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack. 
Once cool drizzle with icing.
4. To make icing: Combine icing sugar, lemon juice and milk or 
water in a small bowl. If mixture is still thick add another  
¼–½ teaspoon milk or water. Mix well to combine. Spoon 
mixture into a zip lock bag. Cut the edge of one corner of 
the bag to make a small opening, gently squeeze icing and 
drizzle over shortbread. Set shortbread aside until icing  
has set.

It’s fascinating to think that out of all of the ingredients 
we use for baking, one of the most important ones is one 
that is invisible to the eye. When we think of leaveners, 
we tend to think of chemical leaveners (baking powder, 
bicarbonate of soda) and biological leaveners like yeast. 
But air, a mechanical leavener, is fantastic when it comes 
to achieving a light and fluffy texture instead of something 
dense and flat. 
Leavening occurs when mixtures release gasses and create 
a porous structure in the batter. These tiny air cells then 
expand (rise) and then maintain their structure when 
heated in the oven. But where does all of this air come 
from in the first place, and how does it make its way into 
the mix? The secret is in the mixing technique. 
Creaming, beating, whisking, kneading stirring and 
whipping are all ways of incorporating air. Ensuring these 
precious air bubbles remain is why so many recipes say 
“do not over mix.” By gently folding in our dry ingredients 
like flour, baking powder, cocoa, etc, we can combine the 
ingredients without running the risk losing air bubbles. 
In order to incorporate the right amount of air into the 
batter, it’s important to mix using the correct speed 
and motion. This is where the Sage Bakery Boss
™
 speed 
selector dial comes in - it takes the guesswork (and the 
physical work) out to ensure your mixture is correctly and 
evenly mixed.

Mixing with the correct speed and motion 
is easy with the Bakery Boss™ 
It’s easy to over mix or under mix
if you don’t know the right speed and motion

Aerated with 
sugar crystals 
fully dissolved
Undissolved 
sugar crystals
Warm,  
lacking in air
30
With scrapingWithout scraping
The action of creaming butter assists in the softening and 
aerating process. But, if you over-beat, excess heat from 
the friction caused by mixing can remove these small 
but necessary air pockets. Be that as it may, the key to 
breaking the sugar crystals down is to ensure it is  
beaten enough. 
So how do you dissolve sugar crystals and still trap the  
air? The key is to stop the butter from sticking to the walls 
of the mixer and not to over mix. If butter sticks to the 
walls, the mixture in the middle gets over mixed while  
the mixture on the sides ends up under mixed.  
This means less air in the middle and more sugar  
crystals on the outside.
For perfectly creamed butter, you need to regularly stop to 
scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a spatula.  
As soon as the mixture turns a paler yellow colour, stop 
and rub the butter between your fingers to check for sugar 
crystals. If you can’t feel any, stop right away.
For the best and most consistent results, use the scraper 
beater that comes with the Bakery Boss™. It has blades like 
a windscreen wiper and scrapes the sides and bottom of 
the bowl with every turn. Not only does it save you time 
from having to stop and scrape with a spatula, but it also 
helps to achieve a smoother, creamer result. The scraper 
beater is about 3 times faster than using the standard 
metal beater so pay close attention to the consistency  
and colour.
