Kneader Recipe
white bread dough
10ml/2 tsp dried yeast (the type that
requires reconstituting)
5ml/1 tsp sugar
250ml/9 fl.oz. warm water
450g/1 lb bread flour
5ml/1 tsp salt
15g/1⁄2oz. lard
1 Place the dried yeast, with the sugar
and water, in a mixing bowl and leave
to froth. The correct water
temperature should be 43°C and can
be achieved by mixing one third
boiling water with two thirds cold
water.
2 Add the remaining ingredients.
Combine the ingredients together on
a low speed until the flour is
incorporated. Then increase the
speed and knead for approximately
2-3 minutes, until the dough is
smooth and elastic. Cover with oiled
cling film and leave the dough to rise
in a warm place for 45-60 minutes.
3 With the mixer removed from the
stand and hand held re-knead the
dough on maximum speed for
30 – 45 seconds, keeping the
kneaders in the mix.
4 Shape the dough into a loaf, or rolls,
and place on greased baking trays.
Cover with oiled cling film and leave
somewhere warm until it has doubled
in size.
5 Bake in a preheated oven at
230°C/450°F/Gas mark 8 for 20-25
minutes (for a loaf) or 10-15 minutes
(for rolls). When ready, the dough
should sound hollow when tapped
on the base.
