CLEANING
ACCESSORIES: use a bottle brush to 
clean inside the accessories.
DOUGH BLADE: remove the detachable 
cap* for a more thorough clean.
23
Always clean it immediately after use 
(using water and washing up liquid).
Always unplug your appliance before you clean it.
MOTOR UNIT: wipe with a soft, damp 
cloth.

4
To preserve the appearance of the 
detachable parts and make them last as 
long as possible, make sure you follow 
these recommendations:
•  Dishwasher: select the minimum 
temperature (< 40 °C) and avoid the 
drying cycle (generally > 60 °C).
•  Washing by hand: do not leave the 
parts immersed in detergent for too 
long. Avoid abrasive products (e.g. 
stainless-steel scrubbers).
•  Detergents: read the manufacturer’s 
instructions to check their compatibility 
with plastic items.
Never leave parts to soak. Dry them straight after washing.
Make sure you dry the stainless steel parts thoroughly to avoid oxidizing stains.
These are purely aesthetic and do not affect the quality of the blades, discs or bowls.
Some foodstuffs such as carrots tend to stain plastic. Rubbing with a piece of kitchen 
paper and a little vegetable oil will remove most of this staining.
* Insert a spoon handle into the dough blade hub to push the cap off from the inside. 
The Compact model’s dough blade does not have a cap.
Warning: always handle the blades and discs with caution, as they are 
extremely sharp.
Never immerse the motor unit in water.
----------------Page (19) Break----------------
USEFUL HINTS & TIPS
SIMPLE
• AUTO button: the motor adapts its speed to the task at hand.
•  PULSE button: for more control over the end result.  
This is the setting you need for precision chopping or blending.  
Place soft foods (e.g. meat, fish or soft cheese) into the freezer for a few minutes to firm 
them up before chopping, grating or slicing them in your food processor.  
NB. they should be firm, not frozen!
PRACTICAL
•  If you want to spend your time using your food processor, rather 
than cleaning it, do the first task in the mini bowl, then move 
on to the midi bowl, and finish off with the main bowl.  
Always start with the hard or dry ingredients and end with the liquid 
ones.
•  If your appliance starts to vibrate, carefully wash and dry the feet, 
and check that you have not exceeded the maximum capacities 
shown on p.7.
          XL LID
●•  The small feed tube is ideal for: 
-  slicing long fruit or vegetables (e.g. cucumbers, carrots, leeks). 
Stand the fruit and vegetables upright and close together.
    -  slicing small fruit or vegetables (e.g. strawberries, kiwi fruit, turnips). 
Introduce them into the small feed tube one at a time. 
- grating long fruit or vegetables (e.g. carrots, courgettes) or chunks of cheese. 
Stack them horizontally in the small feed tube.
●•  The large feed tube is ideal for: 
-  slicing round fruit or vegetables (e.g. oranges, pineapples, apples, pears, mangoes, 
tomatoes, potatoes). 
Either cut them into large pieces before introducing them into the feed tube, or leave 
them whole. 
Make sure you do not fill it beyond the MAX level indicator, otherwise your food 
processor will not start.
          MINI BOWL
•  The mini bowl is ideal for processing small amounts. Use it to chop onions or herbs, mince 
meat, or whiz up dips, salad dressings and mayonnaise.
•  Before chopping fresh herbs, check that both the herbs and the bowl are perfectly clean 
and dry. This will ensure you get the very best results. The herbs will also keep  
for longer.
•  You can use the mini bowl directly as a serving dish, providing you  
remember to remove the metal blade first!

22
                               MIDI BOWL AND DISCS
●•  The midi bowl is ideal for grating and slicing fruit, vegetables and 
cheese. Cabbage: roll the leaves one inside the other after discarding 
the tough core and slice. 
•  Some foodstuffs, such as carrots, tend to stain plastic. Rubbing the part 
with a piece of kitchen paper and a little vegetable oil will remove most of 
the staining.
          MAIN BOWL
● •  Liquid ingredients: never fill the bowl more than a third full.
● •  Solid ingredients: never fill the bowl more than two-thirds full.
         
METAL BLADE
•  When processing large amounts of meat or vegetables, cut the food into 2cm pieces.
•  If your are chopping meat or fish, use the PULSE button to control the end 
result.
•  For vegetable purees, cut the cooked vegetables into large pieces 
before putting them in the bowl with the metal blade. Use the PULSE 
button first, then switch to continuous mode (AUTO) until the puree 
reaches the desired consistency.
           
BLENDERMIX 
•  Soups, pancake batters, cocktails: the metal blade goes in the bowl first, followed by 
all the ingredients, then the Blender
m
ix. Your processor is now ready to run.
The Blender
m
ix attachment gives a smooth volute finish.

USEFUL HINTS & TIPS
23
          DOUGH BLADE
•  Soft dough (brioche, choux pastry, etc.): Magimix food processors 
work on the rapid kneading principle. Doughs are kneaded for just 
30 seconds to 1 minute, the precise time depending on the amount and type of dough. 
Follow the instructions carefully for each recipe.
•  Normal  dough: for faster results, leave the dough to rise or prove at (or slightly above) 
room temperature. As flour is very light, you may sometimes notice a cloud of flour 
escaping from the bowl. To avoid this happening, put all the non-liquid ingredients 
(salt, flour, butter, eggs, etc.) in the bowl before adding the liquid ingredients (water, 
milk, etc.). Only then switch your food processor on.
•  You can store dough in the freezer for up to 2 months, providing you wrap it carefully 
in cling film. Remember to take it out the day before you intend to use it.
          EGG WHISK
• Make sure your bowl is clean and dry.
•  Remember to remove the graduated pusher from the lid to let in enough air!
•  Beaten egg whites: for fluffier egg whites, use eggs that are at room 
temperature.
•  Whipped cream: do not use fat-free or low-fat cream, as it will not whip! 
Make sure the full-fat whipping or double cream you use is chilled. 
Place the food processor bowl in the freezer for 10 minutes beforehand. 
If you can track it down, add some powdered stabilizer (e.g. Whip 
It®) to the cream, as this will keep it stiff for several hours in the fridge.  
Keep a close eye on the cream while it is being whipped, to avoid over 
processing and it turning into butter.
 
          CITRUS PRESS
•  There are 2 cones: a small one for lemons and limes,   
and a large one for oranges and grapefruits.  The small cone is stored inside the large 
cone.

GOLDEN RULES
To get the very best out of our recipes, follow these few simple golden rules:
1. Always use the very best ingredients  
Choose good-quality, fresh ingredients.
The fresher your fruit and vegetables, the more vitamins they will contain. Signs of 
freshness include smooth skin, green leaves and no bruising.
Always use fresh meat and fish.
Pay attention to the type of flour indicated in the recipe. The choice 
of flour is very important, not least because the amount of water 
you need depends on which type you are using. Wholemeal 
flour, for instance, contains more bran, which absorbs more 
water.
Plain flour, a very fine, white, all-purpose flour that is best for making 
cakes, pastries, sauces and pancake batters.
Self-raising flour has low gluten content and contains a raising agent, usually baking 
powder. It’s used in baking and cake-making.
Strong white flour has a higher gluten content and is therefore ideal for making bread 
and brioche.
It is better to use caster sugar, rather than granulated sugar, 
which has coarser crystals. Icing sugar is very fine and is 
commonly used for cake decoration.
Always use butter, never margarine or a low-fat spread.
Yeast comes in two forms – fresh or dried. In our recipes, we 
have chosen to use fresh yeast, which you can get from your local baker, as well as 
from specialist shops (or the bakery section of your nearest supermarket). If you use 
dried yeast, remember to use half the amount indicated for fresh yeast.
For the very best results, always dissolve the yeast in a liquid heated to 35 °C. Yeast is 
a living organism, and if the liquid is any hotter, it will kill it.
Salt regulates the rising action of the yeast and reinforces the structure of the gluten.
It is best to use pasteurised whole milk.
Double cream has a minimum fat content of 48% (35% for whipping cream), compared 
with 15% for single cream and even less for “lite” versions. It not only tastes better, but 
holds air bubbles better when whipped.

GOLDEN RULES
Eggs are sold in four different sizes, with medium eggs weighing 53-63g. For recipes 
where the egg whites are to be beaten, bring them up to room temperature first. Eggs 
must be fresh if they are to be eaten raw in mousses, etc. If you are using them for 
home baking (e.g. meringues, macaroons), it is a good idea to separate them 2-3 
days beforehand, storing the yolks and whites in separate airtight containers in the 
fridge. For egg whites to whisk properly, your bowl must be clean, with no traces of fat.
2. Be prepared! 
The following pieces of equipment always come in useful:
Measurement instruments: precise electronic kitchen scale (range: 
from 2g to 2kg) is vital, as is a cooking thermometer that can measure 
temperatures of up to 200 °C.
Baking tins: it is important to use a baking tin of the right shape, the right 
quality and made from the right material. We specify which kind of tin 
is required for each recipe.
Cakemaking accessories: cutters of different sizes, to vary the 
presentation of cakes and pastries.
A piping bag is vital for filling cream puffs and eclairs, as well as 
making meringues or macaroons.
You will need a rolling pin for rolling your pastry out and a brush for 
buttering your tins and painting egg wash on your bread and brioche.
3. Precision 
In some recipes, especially those for bread and cakes, the instructions must be followed 
to the letter. Always weigh or measure the ingredients out carefully and respect the 
kneading, resting and baking times.
4. Cooking - the grand finale 
How well do you know your oven? The success of your recipe may well depend on it, 
as the temperatures and cooking times in our recipes are merely there to guide you.
These times may vary according to your oven, but will also depend on how finely the 
ingredients have been chopped. It will also depend on the size and material of the 
recipient. This is why we recommend you keep a close eye on the baking process and 
be ready to adjust the cooking time, if necessary.
Avoid opening the oven door while your dish is cooking.
