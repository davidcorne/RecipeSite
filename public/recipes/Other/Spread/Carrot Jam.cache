Carrot Jam
 
3 ingredient carrot jam is really lovely and oddly doesn't taste of carrots at all - it is
just like apricot jam! Try this easy recipe that dates back to the 1800s.
 Makes 2 jam jars of jam.

Ingredients
750 g carrots
450 g granulated sugar
2 lemons (zest of 1 lemon, juice of 2 lemons)
Instructions
1. Peel and grate a carrot to total 50g (2 oz) grated. Set aside.
2. With the rest of the carrots, peel them and chop into rounds. Put in a saucepan and add enough water to
just cover them. Cook until soft, drain and puree. Put the pureed carrots into a fine sieve and push out
any excess water.
3. Weigh out 400g (14 oz) of pureed carrot and discard the rest (though it's great to add to soups, stews or
mixed with maple syrup and added to porridge)
4. Put the puree and the 50g (2 oz) of grated carrot into a large saucepan. Add the granulated sugar and,
while stirring constantly, bring to the boil for five minutes. Skim if it gets frothy.
5. Allow to cool and then stir in the lemon zest and juice. Pour into sterilised, lidded, jars and refrigerate.
Recipe Notes
The easiest way to sterilise the jars is to run them through the dishwasher before you start and use them hot
and dry when the cycle has finished.
