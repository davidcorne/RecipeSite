Soft Pretzel Knots
# Soft Pretzel Knots # 

This is from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/7mjznk/homemade_soft_pretzel_knots/druxlh7/).

## Ingredients ## 

### For Dough
- 350ml warm (40 to 55°C) water 
- 1 tablespoon sugar 
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt 
- 1 package active dry yeast (I used instant and they turned out fine) 
- 625g plain flour
- 55g unsalted butter, melted (all I had on hand was salted and the pretzels tasted great) 

### For Pan

- 2.5 liters water
- ⅔ cup baking soda

### For Baking

- Tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 large egg yolk beaten with 1 tablespoon water 
- Pretzel salt (last substitution, I used cracked sea salt as it’s all I had on hand)


## Method ## 

1. Combine the water, sugar and kosher salt in the bowl of a stand mixer and sprinkle the yeast on top. Allow to sit for 5 minutes or until the mixture begins to foam. 
2. Add the flour and butter and, using the dough hook attachment, mix on low speed until well combined (Note: you can also use good old fashioned kneading). Change to medium speed and knead until the dough is smooth and pulls away from the side of the bowl, approximately 4 to 5 minutes. 
3. Remove the dough from the bowl, clean the bowl and then oil it well with vegetable oil. 
4. Return the dough to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap and sit in a warm place for approximately 50 to 55 minutes or until the dough has doubled in size.
5. Preheat the oven to 230°C. Line 2 half-sheet pans with parchment paper and lightly brush with the vegetable oil. Set aside. 
6. Bring the 2.5l of water and the baking soda to a rolling boil in an 8-quart saucepan or roasting pan. 
7. In the meantime, turn the dough out onto a slightly oiled work surface and divide into 8 equal pieces. Roll out each piece of dough into a 24-inch rope. Make a U-shape with the rope, holding the ends of the rope, cross them over each other and press onto the bottom of the U in order to form the shape of a pretzel. Place onto the parchment-lined half sheet pan.
8. Place the pretzels into the boiling water, 1 by 1, for 30 seconds. Remove them from the water using a large flat spatula. 
9. Return to the half sheet pan, brush the top of each pretzel with the beaten egg yolk and water mixture and sprinkle with the pretzel salt. 
10. Bake until dark golden brown in color, approximately 12 to 14 minutes.

Transfer to a cooling rack for at least 5 minutes before serving.
