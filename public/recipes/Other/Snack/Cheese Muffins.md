# Cheese Muffins # 

This recipe is based on a recipe from [recipetineats](https://www.recipetineats.com/cheese-garlic-muffins/#wprm-recipe-container-25315) but just as plain cheese without the garlic. I've also edited it to be gluten and lactose free.

## Ingredients ## 

- 200g grated cheddar cheese (lactose-free)
- 300g gluten-free plain flour
- 1½ tsp baking powder
- ½ tsp bi-carb soda
- ½ tsp salt
- 1 egg
- 235ml oat milk
- 60g plain lactose-free yoghurt
- 85 ml vegetable oil (or any plain oils, not olive oil)

## Method ## 

1. Preheat oven to 180°C or 160°C fan.
1. Ready a 12 hole muffin tin by greasing it, or using cupcake cases.
1. Whisk 300g flour, 1½ tsp baking powder, ½ tsp bi-carb soda, ½ tsp salt in a bowl.
1. Whisk 1 egg, 235ml oat milk, 60g yoghurt, 85 ml oil in a separate bowl.
1. Pour Wet into the Dry ingredients bowl. Mix lightly (the original recipe suggests 8 times). 
1. Add cheese, mix as few times as possible just to incorporate remaining bits of flour - no more than 7 big stirs (secret to soft muffs).
1. Divide between 12 holes in muffin tin.
1. Bake for 22 - 25 minutes or until the muffins are golden and crusty and spring back when touched in the centre.
1. Remove onto cooling rack and cool slightly before eating!

## Notes ##

- As I've said at the top, I've edited this recipe to make it gluten and lactose free, and it worked very well.
- This works very well as a recipe to cook with kids.
