## Method ## 

### Lamb 

1. Set the water temperature to 56°C.
2. Combine the lamb, tandoori paste, and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large zipper lock or vacuum seal bag. 
3. Seal the bag using the water immersion technique or a vacuum sealer on the moist setting.
4. Place the bag in the water bath and set the timer for 4 hours.

### Sauce 
1. About 75 minutes before the lamb is finished, prepare the sauce: 
    1. Combine the minced onion, large chile, garlic, ginger, cardamom, coriander, cumin, paprika, and turmeric in a mortar and pestle. 
    2. Pound until smooth. (Alternatively, purée in a food processor.) 
    3. Season with salt.
2. Heat remaining tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over medium high heat. 
3. When the oil is shimmering, add the paste and cook until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes.
4. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. 
5. Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, and cinnamon and bring to a simmer. 
6. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 1 hour. 
7. Season to taste with salt.

### Finishing
1. When the timer goes off, remove the bag from the water bath. 
2. Transfer the entire contents of the bag to the sauce on the stove. 
3. Stir and remove from the heat.
4. Stir in the yogurt and season to taste with salt. 
5. Transfer to a serving bowl and garnish with cilantro. Serve with rice, naan bread, and/or papadums.
