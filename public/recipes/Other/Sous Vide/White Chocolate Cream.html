## Ingredients ## 

- 3 egg yolks
- 240ml double cream
- 200g white chocolate

## Method ## 

1. Preheat a water bath to 79.4Â°C.

3. Break up the white chocolate into smaller pieces and add it to the bag.
4. Seal the bag using the water displacement method.
5. Place the bag in the water bath and cook for 1 hour.
6. Remove the white chocolate cream from the bath and transfer to a measuring cup or a container with a pour spout. If the mixture looks separated or curdled, whisk it to smooth it out.
