Before We Begin
Shanks? What are those? 
Oh, baby, you’re in for a treat. A shank is a cut of meat from the lower leg of an
animal. Meat makes up about half the total weight of a shank; bone, fat, skin, and
connective tissue account for the rest. When you cook the shank slowly, the
connective tissue breaks down, making the meat extremely juicy and rich in Njavor.
What kind of shank should I use? 
In this recipe and the associated Joule app guide, our kitchen opted for hind
shanks. You see, there are two types of shanks per animal: fore and hind. Hind
shanks are slightly bigger and are known for being a touch meatier. However, both
types are wonderfully delicious and will work with this recipe. Just note that if you
use foreshanks, you’ll have less meat and it will fall oLJ the bone more easily.
Uh-oh. My meat is frozen. What now? 
Not. To. Worry! When you’re cooking a tough cut for a long time, you can cook
frozen meat for the same amount of time as fresh meat.
Can I use any type of ziplock-style bag for this recipe? 
When you are cooking heavy food, or cooking at temperatures above around
158 °F / 70 °C, the seams of ziplock-style bags can fail and expose food to the
water. When facing a recipe like this, opt for heavy-duty sous vide bags if you can;
if you must use ziplock-style bags, double-bag to reduce the chance of water
intrusion.
I loved braised meats—got any other suggestions? 
Sure do! Download the Joule app for a whole slew of other long-cooked, soul-
warming meats.

1 Heat Joule to167 °F / 75 °C
Cooking your shank at 167 °F / 75 °C gives you very tender, melty meat that almost
falls oLJ the bone. That’s exactly how we like it, but if you prefer some other degree
of doneness, check out the Joule app for other options.
NOTE: Remember, the water in your pot will get hot enough to cook your food—
treat your work surface accordingly! Place a trivet beneath the pot to help protect
your countertop, or use whatever precautions you normally would when exposing
your counter to a dish, pot, or pan you just removed from the oven or stove.
2 Reduce vinegar and tomato paste
500 gBalsamic vinegar
40 gTomato paste Put a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the tomato paste and vinegar, andreduce the mixture until you have a thick sauce. Remove from heat and let cool.
PRO TIP: A good way to tell if a sauce is thick enough is to stick a spoon in it. If the
liquid coats the back of the spoon, it’s good to go. If not, keep simmering until it’s
ready.

3 Season that shank
700 gLamb hind shank
-Salt, as needed
-Black pepper, coarsely
ground, as needed 
Salt and pepper. All over.

4 Bag it up
5Rosemary, fresh sprigs
5Garlic, clovesToss the lamb and some rosemary and garlic or the seasonings of your choice intoa sous vide bag. Once the vinegar reduction cools, drizzle it into the bag.
5 Cook for 24 hours
It’s important to cover your pot to reduce evaporation during long cooks. Use a lid
or some high-quality plastic wrap, then go enjoy your life while Joule takes care of
that melt-in-your-mouth meat.
6 Strain it; reduce it
Transfer the cooked shanks to a plate and strain the remaining sauce through a
NJne-mesh sieve into your saucepan.
Return the pan to the stove and simmer the mixture over medium-high heat until
the glaze is as thick as you like it.
PRO TIP: Don’t rush and burn your food at the last minute—you’ve spent 24 hours
cooking this beautiful meal. A great way to reduce scorching is to scrape the
bottom of the pot with a spatula every so often.
7 Serve it
Drizzle that glaze all over your lamb shank and serve it atop a creamy risotto or
potato purée.
Make it a feast!
