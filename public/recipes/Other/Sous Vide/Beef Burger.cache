1.Preheat a water bath to desired Ąnal temperature using a sous-
vide cooker, according to the chart above.
2.Divide meat into four equal portions and gently shape each one
into a patty slightly wider than your buns. Season generously with
salt and pepper. Place patties in individual zipper-lock bags.
Remove air from zipper-lock bags by closing the bags, leaving the
last inch of the top unsealed. Slowly lower into the preheated
water bath, sealing the bag completely just before it fully
submerges. Cook according to the chart above.
3.To Finish in a Pan: Remove the burgers from the bags and place
them on a paper towel–lined plate. Pat dry very carefully on both
sides and season with additional salt and pepper. Let the burgers
rest at room temperature for 10 minutes to dry their exteriors.
Before searing the burgers, have your toasted buns and
condiments ready to accept them. Heat the oil in a large cast iron
or stainless steel skillet over high heat until lightly smoking. Add
the burger patties and cook, without moving, until just browned,
about 1 minute. Flip the burger and add a slice of cheese to the top
surface (if using). Cook until the second side is browned and the
cheese is melted, 45 seconds to 1 minute longer. Transfer the
burgers to the prepared buns, top as desired, and serve
immediately.
Cooking burgers sous vide allows for unparalleled control over cooking temperature
and, therefore, level of juiciness.

4.To Finish on the Grill: Remove the burgers from the bags and place
them on a paper towel–lined plate. Pat dry very carefully on both
sides and season with additional salt and pepper. Let the burgers
rest at room temperature for 10 minutes to dry their exteriors.
Before searing the burgers, have your toasted buns and
condiments ready to accept them. Light one chimney full of
charcoal (about 5 quarts of coals). When all the charcoal is lit and
covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on one side
of the charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and
allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Alternatively, set half the burners
on a gas grill to the highest heat setting, cover, and preheat for 10
minutes. Scrape the grill grates clean with a grill scraper, then oil
the grates by holding an oil-dipped kitchen towel or paper towels
in a set of tongs and rubbing them over the grates 5 to 6 times.
5.Place the burgers directly over the hot side of the grill and cook
until a deep, rich crust has formed, about 45 seconds to 1 minute.
Flip burgers and add cheese (if using). Cook until the second side is
browned and the cheese has melted, 45 seconds to 1 minute
longer. If the Ąre threatens to ąare up as the burgers drip fat into it,
suĂocate the Ąre by closing the grill lid until the ąames die out.
Alternatively, using a long spatula, transfer the burgers to the
cooler side of the grill until the ąames subside. Do not allow ąames
to engulf the burgers. Transfer the burgers to the prepared buns,
top as desired, and serve immediately.
