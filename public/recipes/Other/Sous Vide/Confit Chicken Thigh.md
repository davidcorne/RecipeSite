Active Time: 15 minutes
Total Time: 8.25 hours
Temp: 74°C
Finishing step: For crispy skin, pan sear in olive oil over medium-high heat.

## Ingredients ## 

- 2 chicken legs
- 60ml extra-virgin olive oil (or chicken fat, duck fat, or lard)
- 4 cloves garlic, crushed
- 2 dried bay leaves
- 3 sprigs of fresh thyme
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter

## Method ## 


1. Set the water to 74°C. 
2. Place all ingredients in a bag, seal, and cook for 8 hours.
3. Remove the chicken from the bag, pat dry, season with salt and pepper, and brown the skin in a medium-hot non-stick saute pan (with or without oil), about three minutes. 
4. Serve on the bone with a salad or pickled vegetables. 

NOTE: If you’re not planning to serve the chicken immediately, you can leave the chicken sealed and refrigerate for up to three days. When ready to serve, remove from the bag, pat dry, season, and sear it then.
