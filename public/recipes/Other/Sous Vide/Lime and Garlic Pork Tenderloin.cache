Lime and Garlic Pork Tenderloin
# Lime and Garlic Pork Tenderloin # 

This is an Anova recipe taken from [here](https://recipes.anovaculinary.com/recipe/sous-vide-lime-and-garlic-pork-tenderloin).

This makes enough for 6.

## Ingredients ## 

- 1 tablespoon garlic powder
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 1 tablespoon dried thyme
- 1 tablespoon dried rosemary
- Pinch lime sea salt
- 1 (3-pound, 1.3 Kg) pork tenderloin, silverskin removed
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter

## Method ## 

1. Set Anova Sous Vide Precision Cooker to 59.4°C (139°F).
2. Combine the garlic powder, cumin, thyme, rosemary, and lime salt in a small bowl and mix thoroughly.
3. Place the pork on a clean flat surface, brush it first with the olive oil, then rub with the kosher salt, followed by the garlic-herb rub.
4. Transfer the pork to a large food-safe bag (or use a sharp knife to cut the tenderloin evenly into two pieces, and place in two medium food-safe bags).
5. Seal using your vacuum sealer or using the water displacement method. Place the sealed bag(s) in the water bath and cook for 2 hours.

### Finishing

1. When the pork is cooked, remove it from the bag, place it on a paper towel–lined plate or baking sheet, and pat it dry. Discard the cooking liquid.
2. Heat a cast iron pan over high heat and add the butter. Add the pork to the pan and sear until browned on all sides, 3 to 4 minutes in total.
3. Remove the pork from the pan and transfer it to a cutting board. Let it rest for 5 minutes before carving into 1- to 2-inch medallions.
