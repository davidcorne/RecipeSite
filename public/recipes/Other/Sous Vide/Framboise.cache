# Framboise # 

**Note: This is very much experimental**

This is based off of 2 recipes; [sous vide limoncello](https://recipes.anovaculinary.com/recipe/2-hour-sous-vide-limoncello) and [non-sous vide framboise](https://www.justapinch.com/recipes/drink/cocktail/framboise-raspberry-liqueur.html).

## Ingredients ## 

- 750ml bottle of vodka
- 400g  raspberries
- 750ml water
- 280g  caster sugar

## Method ## 

1. Set the water temperature to 57ÂºC.
2. Crush the raspberries
3. Combine the raspberries and vodka in a ziplock bag, and immersion seal it.
4. Immerse that in the water bath for 2 hours.
5. While that cooks make sugar syrup:
    1. Heat the water and sugar over a medium-high heat.
    2. Stir until the sugar is dissolved.
    3. Remove from the heat and allow to cool to room temperature.
6. When the timer goes off, remove the raspberry vodka mixture from the bath and put it into an ice bath. This is so that the volatile aromatics return to the liquid.
7. When it is chilled strain the liquid into a bowl and add the syrup.
8. Transfer to a clean bottle with a tight fitting lid.
