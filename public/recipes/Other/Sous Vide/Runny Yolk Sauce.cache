INSTRUCTIONS
Cook's Note: This recipe is easiest to do when using a sous vide device—either a self-contained
insulated box called a water oven or a stick-style water circulator along with a pot of your choice. You
can also follow our instructions below for using a small (8- to 12-quart) cooler and a digital
thermometer. We’ve tested this recipe using both gram measurements and traditional U.S. volume and
weight measurements, so you can pick the one that works best for you. This recipe safely achieves
pasteurization (144 degrees Fahrenheit/62.2 degrees Celsius for at least 6 minutes) and then
continues to heat the yolks to create a sauce with the ideal texture. Store-bought, in-shell, pasteurized
eggs can also be used without any changes to the recipe. The cooking time depends on the number
of yolks, so this recipe cannot be scaled up or down without making adjustments. Don’t discard the
whites—save them to make angel food cake or meringue cookies or freeze them for later. This sauce
can be refrigerated for up to one week.
Use sous vide device to heat water bath to 149 degrees F/65 degrees C.
Alternatively, ు怀ll 8- to 12-quart cooler halfway with boiling water; close lid and
set aside.
1
200 g egg yolks, cleaned of all whites
2 g salt
Using spatula or ladle, push yolks through ు怀ne-mesh strainer into medium
bowl; gently whisk yolks and salt until just smooth (do not overwhisk). Pour
mixture into 1-quart double-zipper zipper-lock bag; seal zipper, leaving ¼-inch
opening on 1 end. Holding bag near opening, allow bag to lie 怀at on counter
so that egg mixture ు怀lls bag and pushes air out opening. Seal bag fully.

If using cooler, add cold water until water in cooler registers 151 degrees
F/66 degrees C. Gently lower bag into water bath or cooler, allowing any
remaining air bubbles to rise to top of bag (do not let go of bag). Reopen 1
corner of zipper, release remaining air pocket, and seal bag fully. Release bag
into water bath or cooler and cook for 32 minutes. If using cooler, stir in
boiling water as necessary to maintain water temperature of 149 degrees
F/65 degrees C; keep cooler lid closed when not adding water.
3
475 g ice cubes
475 g water
Meanwhile, combine ice and water in large bowl; set aside.
4
Remove bag from water bath or cooler and immediately transfer to ice bath;
let chill until cold to touch, at least 10 minutes. Transfer sauce to airtight
container or squeeze bottle and refrigerate until ready to use.
