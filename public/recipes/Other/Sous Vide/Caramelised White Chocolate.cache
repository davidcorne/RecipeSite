Caramelised White Chocolate
# Caramelised White Chocolate # 

This came originally from [here](http://www.veggiechef.co.uk/Blog/files/sous_vide_caramelised_white_chocolate.html).

## Ingredients ## 

- 300g White Chocolate

## Method ## 

1. Heat sous vide setup to 90Â°C
2. Vacuum pack the chocolate.
3. Cook for 6 hours the water bath.

The chocolate will turn a light gown within the first hour or two of cooking then gradually continue to darken. 
I found that 6 hours gave me a great caramelised flavour and intensity, but you could probably even push the cooking time on for another hour or two if you wanted a darker caramel.
