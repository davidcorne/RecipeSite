“Set Joule to 155 °F”
Holy cow, that is pretty cool!

2 Break down chicken (optional)
1Chicken, whole, or pieces,
about 1.8 kgDivide chicken into pieces. You’ll want to end up with skin-on thighs, drumsticks,and two whole, boneless breasts.
Of course, you can always just buy a bunch of chicken pieces—up to you.
3 Season chicken
15 gSaltSeason the pieces all over with salt. A good starting point is about 1 percent salt to
the weight of the pieces.
4 Bag the bird
Place the pieces into sous vide bags, dark meat (thighs and legs) with dark meat,
and breasts with breasts. Make sure pieces don’t overlap with one another.
Transfer breasts to the fridge to chill. We’re gonna cook the dark meat longer than
the white meat—this ensures the former has enough time to do its thing and the
latter retains its juicy goodness.

5 Cook
Drop dark meat in water. Cook for at least 2 hours. Add breasts and cook all pieces
for an additional hour.
6 Heat fryer to400 °F / 204 °C
2 quartFrying oilHeat at least 3 inches / 8 cm of frying oil in a dutch oven or stockpot over high
heat until the oil reaches about 400 °F / 204 °C. (Don’t worry about being super
precise here. A few degrees either way won’t make a big diLJerence.)
TIP: If you are working ahead or plan to fry in batches, set yourself up so that your
chicken pieces will stay warm until service. First, line a sheet pan with a wire rack
and place it on the middle shelf of your oven. Then set the oven to “warm” or to the
lowest possible temperature setting.
7 Make breading
20 gSalt
-Black pepper, as needed 
750 gPastry DŽour, or all-purpose 
25 gPaprika, optional, or other
spices
20 gOnion powder, optional, or
other spices
5 gGarlic powder, optional, or
other spices
500 gButtermilk
Remove cooked chicken pieces from the water and pat dry. Cut breasts in half,
lengthwise, so there will be more surface area for crispy, crusty goodness. Place
chicken pieces on a metal rack.
Set up your breading station: Mix the the dry ingredients together in a bowl and
set aside. Add buttermilk to a second bowl.
Here you have a choice: Do you prefer your chicken more crispy or more crunchy?
If you’re in what we call “the camp that loves to feel the crunchiness in the back of
your head,” dredge pieces in Njour, then buttermilk, then Njour again. For crispier
chicken, just dunk the pieces in the buttermilk, then move them to the bowl with
the dry ingredients, then fry. Not sure what you prefer? Try both and see which
texture you prefer.
Return each breaded piece to the rack and repeat until you’ve coated them all.

Crunchy vs Crispy
The chicken on the left was dredged through Njour twice for a thick, crunchy
coating. The one on the right got just the one Njouring and thus has a thinner,
crispier crust.
8 Fry time
Working in batches, fry the chicken pieces in the oil until they’ve got a gorgeous,
golden crust, about 2–3 minutes. (Remember, the inside is already cooked just the
way you want it, so as soon as the crust looks good, you can pull pieces from the
fryer. Pretty cool, right?)
Transfer the NJnished pieces to the wire rack in the oven to keep warm.
9 Dig in!
Ermahgerd, hot, crispy chicken. What are you waiting for?
