This recipe is from [here](http://modernistcuisine.com/recipes/diastatic-potato-puree/) Note: This is dairy-free, but not vegan.

## Ingredients ## 

- 500g Yukon Gold potatoes. (500g peeled and chopped, see note below)
- 10g Sugar???
- 5g Diastatic malt powder. Note: This must be measured very accurately! Should always be 1% of the weight of the used potatoe.

## Method ## 

1. Pre-heat water bath to 52°C
2. Boil water in a large pot.
3. Add potatoes to the pot, reduce heat and simmer for 30-40 minutes.
4. Stir malt powder into drained potatoes.
5. Blend potatoes until smooth and sticky.
6. Seal in a zip-lock bag, removing as much air as possible with water displacement.
7. Cook sous-vide for 30 minutes.
8. Transfer the puree to a pot and heat to at least 75°C to halt the enzyme activity.
9. Season with salt/pepper and serve immediately.
