The Basics
Beef: Steak Medium Rare2:30
Steaks include tender beef cuts like New York strip, rib 
eye, sirloin, etc. When cooking whole beef roasts, 
such as prime rib, we opt for a slightly higher temperature 
for a nice, fork-tender texture. 
Beef
Use this time-and-temp combo for anything marked 
chop or loin—whether it’s bone-in or boneless, fatty 
or lean. The meat will be juicy and tender, with a 
blush of rosy color.
Pork
Cooked at 65 °C / 149 °F, light-meat pieces will 
emerge juicy and tender. Be sure to take them out of 
the bath before the two-hour mark, after that 
the texture becomes too soft, and will lack the 
yielding quality we expect from poultry.  
Chicken
50 °C / 122 °F is the magic number for almost any type 
of fish you’ll be cooking, from salmon to cod to 
halibut to snapper to branzino. For even cooking, 
portion fish into individual servings before packaging.
Fish
Green vegetables reach their optimal texture—softened, 
but still crunchy—at 5 minutes. After about 20 
minutes, they will begin to lose their vibrant hue.

Think tender cuts like rib eye, New York strip, and sirloin. 
These time and temps are based on a one-inch piece, 
but a skinnier steak won’t overcook in the bath. Be 
careful when pre- and post-searing meat, however, 
as it’s easy to overcook thin pieces when browning. 
Steak
We like to cook whole roasts—large tender cuts 
often labeled under names like prime rib or rib 
roast—at a slightly higher temperature than steaks in 
order to achieve the optimal texture. 
Roast
Here’s where sous vide shines brightest—you’ll be 
blown away the first time you cook a cheaper cut like 
brisket or chuck for 16 hours plus, converting it 
into something that tastes great.

This is the way to cook any pork marked “chop” or “loin” 
to get great results—whether your meat is fatty or lean, 
boneless or bone-in. 
Chop
We cook pork roast at the same temperature as we do 
individual chops—it just takes a while longer. Brine 
your roast ahead of time for even more flavor. 
Roast
Cheaper cuts like pork belly and shoulder need some 
time to cook in the bath, but come out spectacularly 
tender and full of flavor.

As a rule, we cook fish at 50 °C / 122 °F to get that great 
combination of tender and flaky. This works for most 
fish. You can cook several pieces in the same bag, but 
remember to portion before you package; whole fish 
won't cook evenly. 
Fish
Note: Cook times are based on filets that are about 1.5 
inches thick. When preparing thinner 
pieces—from the tail, say—you may want to take 
fish out about 10 minutes early. If you've got a fat 
guy, you may need to tack 
on 10 or so minutes to the total time. Feel free to 
check as you go; you can always toss fish back in the 
bath and keep cooking.

While this time and temp combo will work for a 
variety of root vegetables, keep in mind that the results 
can vary depending on the source of the veg. The 
woody carrots you find at a lot of supermarkets, for 
instance, will soften way slower than organic, farmer’s 
market fare. 
Root Vegetables
Cooked at 85 °C / 185 °F, vegetables will take on a 
lovely crunchy texture and stay that way. After about 
20 minutes, however, they’ll begin to lose their vibrant 
green color and grow darker—the sooner you 
take them out, the prettier they’ll be.
