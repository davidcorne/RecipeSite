Before We Begin
Adobo? Isn’t that Spanish? 
Adobo comes from the Spanish adobar, which means “to marinate,” and many
Spanish-speaking cultures have their own interpretations of the word. (Try the
Puerto Rican spice mix!) When the Spanish colonized the Philippines, they gave
the name to the Filipino technique of preserving food in vinegar and spices.
Can I use other meats with this recipe? 
While the glaze tastes great on many proteins—like chicken and other cuts of
pork—you’ll want to adjust the time and temperature to NJt the meat you’re using.
The time-and-temp combo in this recipe is perfect for pork belly and other fatty,
tough cuts; if you’re cooking something else, check out the Joule app or the Sous
Vide Time & Temperature Guide to see our suggestions.
Uh-oh. My meat is frozen. What now? 
When you’re cooking a tough cut for a long time, you can cook frozen meat for the
same amount of time as fresh meat. But keep in mind that frozen pork belly will be
hard to cut into cubes for this recipe. If you’re cooking from frozen, just sear the
slab of belly right from the freezer and cook it whole.
Can I use any type of ziplock-style bag for this recipe? 
When you are cooking heavy food, or cooking at temperatures above around
158 °F / 70 °C, the seams of ziplock-style bags can fail and expose food to the
water. When facing a recipe like this, opt for heavy-duty sous vide bags if you can;
if you must use ziplock-style bags, double-bag to reduce the chance of leaks.
I loved braised meats—got any other suggestions? 
Sure do! Download the Joule app for a whole slew of other long-cooked, soul-
warming meats.

1 Heat Joule to158 °F / 70 °C
Cooking your pork belly at 158 °F / 70 °C gives you a super-succulent cut of meat
that you can eat with just a fork. That’s exactly how we like it, but if you prefer
some other degree of doneness, check out the Joule app for other options.
NOTE: Remember, the water in your pot will get hot enough to cook your food—
treat your work surface accordingly! Place a trivet beneath the pot to help protect
your countertop, or use whatever precautions you normally would when exposing
your counter to a dish, pot, or pan you just removed from the oven or stove.
2 Slice and season that belly
450 gPork belly, skin on
-Salt, as needed
-Black pepper, coarsely
ground, as needed 
Slice belly into 2 in (5 cm) cubes. Sprinkle with salt and coat very generously with
cracked black pepper.
NOTE: Keep in mind that you’re going to serve this with a pretty potent sauce. If
you don’t like salty things, you can skip the salt here.
3 Prep your veggies and seasonings
1Sweet onion
2Garlic, cloves
8Bay leaf, fresh
0.2 gChili DZakes
Chop onion into thick pieces and mince garlic. Add to a bowl with bay leaves and
chili Njakes.
PSST: When cooking vegetables for a long time, you don’t need to worry about the
size. After 24 hours, those onions are going to be soft no matter what. Really, you
just want to cut them into perfect bites—whatever size that is for you.
4 Presear for ultimate Njavor
-Olive oil, as neededHeat oil in a pan over high heat. Add the belly and sear on all sides. After NJve
minutes, the pork should be golden and crispy—remove it and drain oLJ the excess
fat, but keep the pan on the heat.
5 Make the glaze
150 gCane vinegar, Datu Puti or
brand of your choice 
200 gSoy sauce, Silver Swan or
brand of your choice 
400 mlCoconut milk, 1 can (13.5 DZ oz)
Add your prepared veggies, herbs, and spices to your pan. Once the veggies have
started to brown, pour in the vinegar, soy sauce, and coconut milk.
Reduce the heat to medium-high and simmer the mixture until you’ve got a thick
glaze. You’re trying to reduce this sauce as much as possible without burning
anything—when you get close to the end, make sure you’re scraping the bottom
of the pan and mixing well to prevent anything from getting scorched.
Remove the glaze from heat and allow it to cool.
PRO TIP: When thickening sauces and glazes, test ’em with a spoon every once in
a while. When the glaze coats the back of the spoon, it’s good to go.

6 Put it all in the bag
Add your pork belly and cooled glaze to a bag or bags, taking care not to
overcrowd them.
7 Cook with Joule for 24 hours
Use a lid or high-quality plastic wrap to cover your pot—this reduces evaporation
over the 24-hour cook. Then go enjoy your life while Joule prepares your adobo.
8 Serve it up!
All this dish needs is some simple jasmine rice to absorb that porky, juicy
goodness.

There’s more cooked meat where that came from.
