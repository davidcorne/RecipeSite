Pulled Pork
# Pulled Pork # 

This is originally from [here](https://www.greatbritishchefs.com/how-to-cook/how-to-cook-pulled-pork-sous-vide).

## Ingredients ## 

- 1kg pork shoulder
- 1 tbsp of ketchup
- 4 tbsp of mustard
- 2 tbsp of soy sauce
- 2 tbsp of honey

## Method ## 

1. Heat water to 70Â°C
2. Now prepare the meat. Remove the excess fat from the shoulder and pat dry
3. In a medium bowl, make a paste for the pork by combining all of the marinade ingredients, mixing well until incorporated. 
4. Evenly and liberally, coat the entire surface of the pork in the marinade
5. Place the meat into a large food-grade cooking pouch with any excess marinade and vacuum seal, ensuring the meat is flattened out and has an even coating of marinade
6. Place the meat in a rack and lower into the water bath - the rack will stop the pork from floating to the surface. 
7. Cook for 24 hours
8. Remove the pouch from the water bath, cut open, remove the pork from the bag and allow to cool slightly in a dish. 
9. Tip the juices and marinade from the bag into a pan and warm the juices over a low heat for 5-7 minutes until thickened and sticky. 
10. Use a blowtorch to lightly char the outside of the pork - this will help to caramelise the outside, giving you a nice charred flavour. Alternatively, you can colour the outsides in a hot pan
11. Working with a pair of forks (or clean fingers) pull the meat into shreds
12. Once the meat is shredded to the desired thickness, add the thickened sauce and mix well to combine
