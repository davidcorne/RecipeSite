Balsamic Reduction
# Balsamic Reduction # 

This is a recipe with technique from [here](https://www.joyfulhealthyeats.com/balsamic-reduction/), and added to.

## Ingredients ## 

- 250ml balsamic vinegar
- ~30ml of maple syrup (~2 tbsp)
- 1 clove of garlic
- 1Â½ tsp of thyme

## Method ## 

1. Dice the garlic, very finely.
2. In a saucepan, fry the garlic in a small amount of oil on a low heat.
3. When it's lightly fried, add the vinegar and maple syrup.
4. Measure the depth of the liquid in the pan, **note this down!**
5. Turn heat to medium/high and bring the mixture to a boil.
6. Add the thyme
7. Simmer for 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally. The important thing now, is to reduce it until there's half as much as when we started.
8. When there's half the volume left, remove from the heat.
9. This may need some stirring as it cools, but once cool can be refrigerated.
10. If it's too thick once refrigerated, it should be heated for ~30 seconds in a microwave.
