Dead good hollandaise
Method
Melt 125g butter in a saucepan and skim any white solids from
surface. Keep the butter warm. Put 2 egg yolks, 1/2 tsp tarragon
vinegar or white wine vinegar, a pinch of salt and a splash of ice-
cold water in a metal or glass bowl that will fit over a small pan.
Whisk for a few minutes then put the bowl over a pan of barely
simmering water and whisk continuously until pale and thick, about
3-5 minutes.
Remove from the heat and slowly whisk in the melted butter, bit
by bit until it’s all incorporated and you have a creamy hollandaise.
(If it gets too thick, add a splash of water.) Season with a squeeze of
lemon juice and a little cayenne pepper. Keep warm until needed.
To make eggs Benedict, toast 2 muffin halves, top each with a
slice of warmed ham, a poached egg and spoon over a generous
helping of hollandaise.
