Basil Oil
# Basil Oil # 

This is a recipe from [here](https://www.finecooking.com/recipe/basil-oil).

## Ingredients ## 

- 1 cup mild olive oil
- 2 cups tightly packed sweet basil leaves
- Kosher salt

## Method ## 

1. Put the measured oil in the refrigerator while you prepare the basil.
2. Bring a pot of water to a boil and have a bowl of ice water ready.
3. Blanch the basil leaves in the boiling water for about 10 seconds.
4. Remove them quickly with a strainer and dunk in the ice water, swishing them around to be sure they’re all cold.
5. Remove from the water and squeeze gently to remove the excess water.
6. Roughly chop the basil and put it in a blender.
7. Add the oil and ½ tsp kosher salt.
8. Blend until the basil is pureed, the mixture will be very frothy.
9. Let the puree settle for about 30 min.
10. Strain through a cheesecloth-lined fine strainer, very gently pushing on the solids to extract the oil.
11. Use immediately or refrigerate for up to a week. For the best flavor, let the oil come to room temperature before using.
