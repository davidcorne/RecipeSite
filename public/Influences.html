# Influences # 

This is a generally ordered list of my cooking influences, with links to where they keep their recipes.

## General

- [Serious Eats](http://seriouseats.com/) is an incredible site full of well tested recipes based on science.
- [J. Kenji LÃ³pez-Alt](http://www.kenjilopezalt.com/) is one of the authors from serious eats. His book *The Food Lab* was one of the reasons I got deeper into cooking.
- My Mum. My Mum is an excellent cook and always encouraged my love of cooking. Crucially she is also always keen to talk about cooking and the latest thing I've been making.

## Masterchef Australia

Masterchef Australia is a huge influence, and these are some of the contestants who have really inspired me.

- [Derek Lau](https://www.dereklau.com.au/), came 7th in Masterchef AU 2019 and has a great technical cooking style. Cooks great dessert and asian flavours.
