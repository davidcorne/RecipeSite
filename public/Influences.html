# Influences # 

This is a generally ordered list of my cooking influences, with links to where they keep their recipes.

## General

- [Serious Eats](http://seriouseats.com/) is an incredible site full of well tested recipes based on science.
- [J. Kenji LÃ³pez-Alt](http://www.kenjilopezalt.com/) is one of the authors from serious eats. His book *The Food Lab* was one of the reasons I got deeper into cooking.
- My Mum. My Mum is an excellent cook and always encouraged my love of cooking. Crucially she is also always keen to talk about cooking and the latest thing I've been making.

## Masterchef Australia

Masterchef Australia is a huge influence, and these are some of the contestants who have really inspired me.

- [Derek Lau](https://www.dereklau.com.au/), came 7th in Masterchef AU 2019 and has a great technical cooking style. Cooks great dessert and asian flavours.

## Gluten Free Baking

There are a number of great gluten free cooking sites I use, here are a good number of them:

- [The Loopy Whisk](https://theloopywhisk.com/diet/gluten-free/) I used her GF pasta recipe and it works really well. Well described, talks about the flour she uses but uses a small number of ingredients well rather than making her own flour mixture.
- [Dove Farm](https://www.dovesfarm.co.uk/recipes/freee) they're the makers of the flour I tend to use, they have some great and reliable recipes too. And you're more reassured that they'll work with the flour they produce.
